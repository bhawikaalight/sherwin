            "text": "Non-Tobacco Use Medical Plan Contribution Rate Frequently Asked Questions and Answers As part of our ongoing commitment to your good health, we are continuing a non-tobacco user rate to employee medical plan contributions in 201.  If you enroll in a Sherwin-Williams medical plan during Open Enrollment and confirm that you andyour covered dependents (spouse and dependent children) have not used tobacco within the last six months, you will receive the non-tobacco user rate for your employee medical plan contribution in 201 If you and/or your covered dependents enroll in a Sherwin-Williams medical plan during OpenEnrollment and have used tobacco within the past six months, you are not eligible for the non-tobacco user rate for your employee medical plan contribution. How is tobacco use defined? Tobacco use includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes and any form of smokeless tobacco (i.e. chew).  Tobacco use is defined as any use of tobacco within the past six months by yourself and/or a covered dependent on your Sherwin-Williams medical plan. Why do you offer a contribution differential based on tobacco use? The primary goal of our health and wellness programs is to help employees and their family members reach and maintain good health.  Consider some facts about tobacco use: Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.  It is responsible forone in five deaths  For every one person killed by tobacco each year, another 20 suffer tobacco-related illness ordisability Tobacco use is the number one risk factor for heart disease and strokeAdverse health consequences of tobacco use include cancer, heart disease, emphysema, asthma,diabetes and neonatal complications70% of all tobacco users want to quitBy providing a discount to non-tobacco users, we hope to provide an added incentive to the better health, quality of life and savings that quitting tobacco provides. How will employee/dependent tobacco use be confirmed? As a full-time benefits-eligible employee, you are being asked to indicate your family tobacco use by completing a field in GEMS, our Global Employee Management System.  Youll need to log into GEMS and update this Family Tobacco Use field prior to and during the Open Enrollment period so the correct employee contributions are displayed during Open Enrollment for your status.  If you currently waive coverage under the Sherwin-Williams medical plans, you are still required to update the Family Tobacco Use status in GEMS in order to provide you with correct rates should you choose to elect coverage in the future You need to update your Family Tobacco Use status in GEMS by November 1, 201.  If you do not update your Family Tobacco Use status during this window, your status will be defaulted to tobacco use for Open Enrollment, and you will not be eligible for the non-tobacco use discount on your employee medical plan contribution.   What will happen if Im not honest about my tobacco use? We expect our employees to be honest in providing information to the Company.  When you update your Family Tobacco Use status in GEMS, you will be confirming that the information you are providing is true.  Falsification of information regarding employee benefits is serious, and may be subject to disciplinary action.     What if I only smoked once (a cigar while golfing) in the past six months? This example would count as tobacco use under this program. My spouse smokes, but I dont.  My spouse is covered under my Sherwin-Williams medical plan.  Am I eligible for the non-tobacco user discount? No.  Because your spouse uses tobacco and is covered under a Sherwin-Williams medical plan, you are not eligible for the non-tobacco use discount. If I use tobacco currently, how can I become eligible for the discount? You can become eligible for the non-tobacco user discount outside of the Open Enrollment period if you and/or your covered dependent using tobacco enroll in and successfully complete the Sherwin-Williams Alere Wellbeing Quit for Life tobacco cessation program. You are eligible for the non-tobacco user discount once Alere provides us with documentation of program completion. What if I quit using tobacco on my own? Each year prior to Open Enrollment, you have the opportunity to update your Family Tobacco Use status for the following plan year.  You can only become eligible for the non-tobacco user discount outside of Open Enrollment through enrollment and completion of the Alere Wellbeing Quit for Life program. How does the Alere Wellbeing Quit for Life program work? Alere offers one-on-one telephone-based treatment sessions with a professional Quit Coach.  Once you enroll, support is available even if you start using tobacco again during the program.  When you enroll in the program, you will receive: Phone-based treatment sessions scheduled at your convenienceToll-free telephone access to the Quit Coaches for the duration of your treatmentRecommendations on type, dose, and duration of medication, if appropriateDelivery of recommended nicotine replacement products (such as patches or gum)Quit Guides designed to help you stay on track between callsHow much does it cost to enroll in this program? The cost of the Quit for Life Program is completely paid for by Sherwin-Williams.  The program is available to all regular full-time and regular part-time employees and their dependents, 18 years of age or older.  This program includes treatment sessions, the Quit Guides, and nicotine replacement products, if recommended by the Quit Coach.  The Alere Wellbeing Quit Coaches are not licensed physicians.  If an employee chooses to use prescription medication, they must obtain a prescription from their physician and pay the prescription co-pay.  Employees will not be reimbursed for the cost of prescription medication co-pays and prescription medication not covered by the plans prescription drug program. You can enroll in this program by calling the toll free number (1-866-QUIT-4-LIFE/1-866-784-8454) or by logging on to the Sherwin-Williams Alere Wellbeing website (www.quitnow.net/Sherwin), click on the Start Here button and follow the instructions.

Youll find information about your medical plan options, about choosing a doctor and sharing the cost of your care, and details about certain important plan rules and requirements.  Words and phrases that appear in bold type are defined in this brochures Appendix A: Glossary.     Please see the brochure An Overview Guide: Your Health and Welfare Benefits, distributed with this brochure for other important information about the Aetna medical Benefit Program, including information about eligibility, enrollment, and your rights under ERISA, COBRA and HIPAA.  For more information on coverage, please refer to the Summary of Benefits, distributed with this document and available at www.sherwinbenefits.com, which provides more detailed information such as the amounts of deductibles, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums.  Medical Plan Options Available Through Aetna  Sherwin-Williams offers the following medical plan options through Aetna:   Advantage Plan;  Prime Plan; and   Standard Plan.  Out-of-Area plan options are also available if the above options are not available in your area (if Out-of-Area coverage is available to you, it will be shown in GEMS).  More information about each of the options is included below.  Employees in certain locations may be eligible for Passive versions of the Standard, Prime and Advantage Options.  These locations include Effingham, Flora, parts of Georgia and the Virgin Islands.  These Passive plans allow Employees to utilize out-of-network providers at in-network costs due to limited access to in-network providers in certain areas.     2  Prescription drug coverage is provided for each of the options through the Caremark Prescription Drug Benefit Program.  The plan described in this brochure is a self-insured benefit plan of Sherwin-Williams. These benefits are not insured with Aetna or any of its affiliates, but will be paid from Sherwin-Williams funds. Aetna will provide certain administrative services under the Aetna medical benefits plan.  Aetna agrees with Sherwin-Williams to provide administrative services in accordance with the conditions, rights, and privileges as set forth in this brochure.  Sherwin-Williams selects the products and benefit levels under the Aetna plan.  The brochure describes your rights and obligations, what the Aetna plan covers, and how benefits are paid for that coverage. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions in this brochure. Your brochure includes the corresponding Summary of Benefits, Summaries of Benefits and Coverage, and any amendments.  This brochure replaces and supersedes all Aetna brochures describing coverage for the medical benefits plan described in this brochure that you may previously have received.  Prime and Advantage Plans  There are two parts to the Prime and Advantage Plans:  a medical plan with a high deductible and an HSA.   Medical Plan Overview  In the Prime and Advantage Plans, your medical plan is paired with an HSA.  Once you meet the deductible, the medical plan starts to pay benefits.  Also, there are a number of services for which you have first dollar coverage (i.e., you are not subject to the deductible).    Refer to the Summary of Benefits for more information on coverage.    You have the freedom to choose your doctor or health care facility when you need health care.  You are not required to select a primary care physician or obtain referrals for specialty care.  How your care is covered and how much you pay out of your own pocket depends on whether the expense is covered by the plan and whether you choose an in-network provider or an out-of-network provider.  Health Savings Accounts  You can save up to the maximum contribution limit of $3,350 (including any Sherwin-Williams employer contribution) for an individual HSA and $6,750 for a family HSA.  Employees age 55 to age 65 can contribute an additional $1,000 over the above limits in their SW-sponsored HSA account.  Spouses age 55 to age 65 can also contribute an additional $1,000 by opening their own HSA account at a financial institution.   3  If you enroll in the Prime Plan HSA, you may be eligible for a Company contribution to your HSA (the Advantage Plan HSA does not include a Company contribution element).  For 2016, the Company contribution will be up to $800 (for family coverage, $400 for single coverage), if you are enrolled for the full year.  The Company contribution is determined once per plan year either January 1 or after your initial enrollment date.  Your coverage effective date must be on or before June 1 of the plan year in order to receive the Company contribution.  You can use your account to pay for qualified medical expenses.  Qualified medical expenses generally include your medical deductible, coinsurance payments and prescription drug expenses.  Or, you may pay for your expenses out of pocket and let your account grow and earn interest for future expenses.  Since account balances roll over from year to year, your account can accumulate over time.  Fidelity Investments is the administrator of the HSA.  You must open your HSA at Fidelity before any contributions can be made.  You can open your account or perform other account activities by logging on to the Fidelity website at www.401k.com or by calling 1-800-323-4015.  Your account is portable.  If you retire or leave the Company for any reason, you take the balance of your HSA with you.  Standard Plan Option  In the Standard Plan, you share in the cost of care by paying a deductible and coinsurance.  However, there are a number of services for which you have first dollar coverage (i.e., not subject to the deductible.)  There is also an out-of-pocket maximum that limits the amount you are responsible for in a calendar year.  Refer to the Summary of Benefits for more information on coverage.  You have the freedom to choose your doctor or health care facility when you need health care.  You are not required to select a primary care physician or obtain referrals for specialty care.  How your care is covered and how much you pay out of your own pocket depends on whether the expense is covered by the plan and whether you choose an in-network provider or an out-of-network provider.  Out-of-Area plans  Aetnas network may not be available in certain areas.  If this is the case in your area, you may enroll in one of the out-of-area plan options.    Each out-of-area plan is an indemnity plan.  When you need care, you choose any licensed provider (there is no provider network).  You may need to pay for your care at the time you receive it, then file a claim for reimbursement.  Or your provider may submit a claim for you and bill you for the balance after the claim is processed.  All benefits are based on the reasonable and customary charge for a given service or supply.  If you are charged more than the reasonable and customary charge, you must pay the difference, which does not apply to your deductible or out-of-pocket limit.   4  The out-of-area plan options have the same coverage level as the in-network coverage level listed in the Summary of Benefits.  Note:  If out-of-area coverage is offered to you, it will be shown on the GEMS online enrollment.    5  USING THE AETNA PROVIDER NETWORK  What is the Provider Network?  You and your covered family members can receive care from doctors and facilities that belong to Aetnas network  called in-network providers.  To participate in Aetnas network, a doctor or other healthcare provider must meet certain standards in a process called credentialing, which looks at factors such as education, residency, board certification and licensing and admitting privileges.  The providers in the network represent a wide range of services, from basic, routine care (general practitioners, pediatricians, internists, etc.), to specialty care (cardiologists, urologists, etc.), to health care facilities (hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, etc.).  When they join the network, the providers agree to provide services or supplies at negotiated fees.  Finding an In-Network Provider  You can use DocFind at: www.aetna.com/docfind/custom/sw, or call Aetna Member Services at 1-800-259-2268.  A Member Services representative can help you find an in-network provider in your area.  The Member Services toll-free number is printed on your ID card.    If you have not already registered for Aetna Navigator, to use DocFind you will need to follow these search instructions:  When prompted to select a plan, choose:   Aetna Choice POS II from the list of Aetna Open Access plans if you are enrolled in the Standard Plan; or  Aetna Choice POS II from the list of Aetna HealthFund plans if you are enrolled in the Prime or Advantage Plans.  If you are registered for your Aetna secure member website, you will not have to select a plan.  You can search the online directory for a specific doctor, type of doctor or all the doctors in a given zip code and/or travel distance.   Using In-Network and Out-of-Network Providers  When you need care, you have a choice.  You can select a doctor or facility that belongs to Aetnas network (an in-network provider) or one that does not belong (an out-of-network provider).   If you use an in-network provider, youll pay less out of your own pocket for your care.  You wont have to fill out claim forms because your in-network provider will file claims for you.  In addition, your provider will make the necessary telephone call to start the precertification process if you must be hospitalized.  6   If you use an out-of-network provider, youll pay more out of your own pocket for your care.  You may be required to file your own claims and make the telephone call required for precertification.  Important:  Benefit maximums and limits in the plan are combined between in-network and out-of-network care unless stated otherwise.  Reasonable and Customary Charges vs. Negotiated Fees  When you receive care from an out-of-network provider, your benefits are based on the reasonable and customary charge for a service or supply (as determined by Aetna).  The reasonable and customary charge is the prevailing charge for health care services in a given geographic area.  If an out-of-network provider charges you more than the reasonable and customary charge, you must pay the difference.  This excess amount will not apply toward your deductible or payment limit.   When you receive care from an in-network provider, your benefits are based on Aetnas negotiated fees.  These are the fees that in-network providers agree to charge Aetna members for their services.  In this case, the reasonable and customary rule does not apply.  Primary Care Physicians (PCP)  You are not required to choose a PCP.  But its a good idea to develop a relationship with a primary care doctor who can be your personal health care manager.  He or she gets to know your personal health history and health care needs, and maintains all of your records.  Your PCP also can recommend a specialist when you need care that he or she cant provide.  This can be very helpful, since its not always easy to choose the right specialist.  Specialists  Specialists are doctors such as oncologists, cardiologists, allergists, chiropractors, neurologists or podiatrists.  When you need specialty care, you can make an appointment directly.  No referral is required.  Remember, youll pay less out of your own pocket when you use an in-network provider.  Remember to use DocFind at www.aetna.com/docfind/custom/sw to find in-network providers in your area.     7  COST SHARING  This section explains fees and costs associated with the Aetna plan options.  It provides information on deductibles, co-payments, and out-of-pocket maximums.    More information regarding coverage, is available in the Summary of Benefits, which provides additional information regarding the deductibles, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums for the Standard, Prime and Advantage options.    You share in the cost of your care by paying deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.  Deductible:  The calendar year deductible is the part of covered expenses you pay each year (January 1 to December 31) before the plan starts to pay benefits.  Expenses for both in-network and out-of-network care are applied to the deductible during the year if you have single coverage.  Once you meet the individual deductible, the plan starts to pay benefits for you.  Each January 1, you start over with a new deductible.  Family Deductible:  This is an aggregate deductible which means that the combined deductible expenses for all covered family members must reach the family deductible amount before the plan will then begin to pay benefits for all covered family members.  Coinsurance:  Once you meet the calendar year deductible, the plan begins paying benefits for covered expenses.  When the plans coinsurance is less than 100%, you pay the balance.  The part you pay is called your coinsurance.  Remember, you can use your HSA to pay for qualified medical expenses which generally include your medical deductible and coinsurance payments.  Or you may pay these expenses out of pocket and let your account grow and earn interest for future expenses.  Out-of-Pocket Maximum:  The plan puts a limit on the dollar amount you pay for covered expenses out of your own pocket  called the out-of-pocket maximum.  Once your share of covered expenses (including the deductible) reaches the individual out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% of covered expenses for the rest of the calendar year.    2015 Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum:  The family coinsurance limit applies to the family as a group.  When your familys combined coinsurance expenses satisfy the family out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% of the familys covered medical charges for the remainder of the calendar year.  2016 Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum:  The individual out-of-pocket maximum applies to any individual in a family and then is combined to determine the family out-of-pocket maximum.  If a family member meets the individual out of pocket maximum, that individuals covered medical expenses will be paid at 100% for the remainder of the calendar year.  When the family out-of-pocket maximum is reached (any combination of family members), the plan pays 100% of the familys covered medical expenses for the remainder of the calendar year.   8  Each January 1, you start over with a new out-of-pocket maximum.  Some expenses for services do not apply to the out-of-pocket maximum.  Thus, these expenses will never be paid at 100%.  The following expenses do not apply to the out-of-pocket maximum:   Non-covered charges (e.g. expenses in excess of reasonable and customary charges, etc.);  Excluded services; and  Precertification penalties.  Copayments (also called copays):  For certain types of expenses, you pay a copayment.  A copay is a flat fee that you pay for a covered service.  Copays do not apply to your annual deductible.     9  IMPORTANT PROGRAM RESOURCES AND CONTACTS  Important Contact Information Aetna Claims Address:  Aetna P.O.

These programs are described in the Special Programs section of this brochure.   11  PRE-CERTIFICATION  What is Precertification?  In order to receive full benefits from the plan, you must follow the precertification rules described in this section.  Precertification is a review of inpatient hospital admissions to make sure the care recommended is right for the patients condition.  This review takes place before you or a covered family member is admitted as an inpatient.    How to Precertify  Precertification starts with a telephone call to Aetna.  If you receive care from an out-of-network provider or you are in an out-of-area plan option, you must make the call.  If you receive care from an in-network provider, your provider is responsible for taking care of all precertification.  Your benefits may be reduced if:   You dont make the call when required; or  Aetna doesnt certify the care your doctor has recommended.  Precertification of Inpatient Hospital Admissions  You are responsible for getting precertification for the services in the following list if your care will be given by an out-of-network provider:   For emergency admission:  within 48 hours of admission or as soon as reasonably possible;  For urgent admission:  before you are scheduled to be admitted; and  For other admissions:  at least 14 calendar days prior to admission.

Concurrent Review and Discharge Planning  The concurrent review process assesses any needs for continued stays, level of care, and quality of care for those receiving inpatient services.  All inpatient services extending beyond the initial certification period require concurrent review.   12  Discharge planning may begin at any stage of the patient management process if post-discharge needs are identified through the precertification or concurrent review process.  The discharge plan may include initiation of a variety of services/benefits that a member will use after discharge from an inpatient stay.  Retrospective Record Review  The purpose of retrospective review is to analyze potential quality and utilization issues, initiate appropriate follow-up action based on quality or utilization issues, and review all appeals of inpatient concurrent review decisions for the coverage and payment of healthcare services.  Aetna's effort to manage the services provided to members includes the retrospective review of claims submitted for payment, and of medical records submitted for potential quality and utilization concerns.     13  WHAT THE MEDICAL PLAN COVERS  This section describes the services and supplies covered under the medical plans.

Refer to Appendix A: Glossary for a definition of necessary.  An expense is incurred on the day you receive a health care service or supply.   The plan does not pay benefits for expenses incurred before your coverage starts or after it ends, even if the expenses were incurred because of an accident, injury or illness that occurred, began or existed while your coverage was in effect.

Outcome of Covered Services and Supplies  Neither Sherwin-Williams nor Aetna is responsible for, and neither makes any guarantees concerning, the outcome of the covered services and supplies you receive.  Aetna Clinical Policy Bulletins  Aetna uses its Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs) as a resource when making benefit and claim decisions.  CPBs are written on selected health care topics, such as new technologies and new treatment approaches.  The CPBs can be found at www.aetna.com and describe whether Aetna has determined that a service or supply is medically necessary, based on clinical information.  Aetnas CPBs are based on evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature, technology assessments and structured evidence reviews, evidence-based consensus statements, expert opinions of healthcare providers, and evidence-based guidelines from nationally recognized professional healthcare organizations and public health agencies.  The CPBs can be technical because they are developed for use in benefit administration.

Caremark will reimburse only the Caremark prescription discount price for prescriptions filled at a non-participating pharmacy.  Maintenance Choice Program  You have a choice in how you order and receive your 90-day maintenance prescriptions.  You can receive your 90-day prescriptions through the CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy or you can have your prescription filled at your local CVS or Target pharmacy.

You can opt out of the program by contacting CVS Caremark.  Generic Step Therapy  This program promotes the first-line use of generic medications to help reduce pharmacy costs.  These strategies help to reinforce the utilization of more cost-effective generics and preferred brand drugs.  Advanced Control Specialty Formulary  The Advanced Control Specialty formulary includes specialty generics and clinically effective brand therapies, and combines other specialty programs such as Specialty Guideline Management (SGM) to help ensure appropriate utilization. Members are required to try the preferred medication(s) within the drug class prior to receiving coverage for the non-preferred drug.  When the targeted specialty prescription is presented to the pharmacy, the claim will reject with the non-formulary message and will be routed to our case review unit to administer the SGM program and step program.  The use of the preferred product will be evaluated with your doctor during the review process and medical necessity will be considered/granted if clinically appropriate.               45  SPECIAL PROGRAMS  As participants in the medical plan, you and your covered family members can take advantage of the special care, discount, vision and fitness programs described in this section.

Transplant services performed at out-of-network facilities are not covered.  Note:  Aetna requires precertification at the time of evaluation for transplant services.

Keeping Records of Expenses  Its important to keep records of medical expenses for yourself and all covered family members.  These will be required when you must file a claim for benefits.  Of particular importance are:   Names and addresses of physicians;  The dates on which expenses are incurred; and   Copies of all itemized bills and receipts.  Filing Claims  If you use an out-of-network provider or are in an out-of-area plan, you are responsible to file a claim to be reimbursed for covered expenses.  To file a claim, you complete a claim form.  (Claim forms are available on Aetna Navigator at www.aetna.com or by calling Aetna Member Services at 1-800-259-2268.)  The form contains instructions on how and when to file a claim, as well as the address to which you should send your completed form.    Claims should be submitted to the address shown on your ID card.  All claims must be filed promptly.  The deadline for filing a claim is 12 months after the date you incurred a covered expense.  If, through no fault of your own, you are unable to meet this deadline, your claim will still be accepted if you file as soon as possible.  However, if a claim is filed more than two years after the deadline, it will not be covered unless you are legally incapacitated.  You can file claims for benefits and appeal adverse claim decisions yourself or through an authorized representative.  An authorized representative is a person you authorize, in writing, to act on your behalf.  The plan will also recognize a court order giving a person authority to submit claims on your behalf, except that in the case of a claim involving urgent care, a health care professional with knowledge of your condition may always act as your authorized representative.  Time Frames for Claim Processing  Aetna will make a decision on your claim.  For concurrent care claims, Aetna will send you written notification of an affirmative benefit determination.  For other types of claims, you may only receive written notice if Aetna makes an adverse benefit determination.  Aetna will provide you with written notices of adverse benefit determinations within the time frames shown in the following chart.  These time frames may be extended under certain limited circumstances.  The notice you receive from Aetna will provide important information that will  50  assist you in making an appeal of the adverse benefit determination, if you wish to do so.  Please refer to the next section, The Appeal Process for Aetna, for more information about appeals.Type of Claim Response Time Urgent care claim: a claim for medical care or treatment where delay could:  Seriously jeopardize your life or health, or your ability to regain maximum function; or   Subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the requested care or treatment.

You will then have at least 48 hours to provide the information.  A decision on your claim will be made within 48 hours after the additional information is provided.    For non-urgent pre-service and post-service claims: The time frames may be extended for up to 15 additional days for reasons beyond the plans control.  In this case, Aetna will notify you of the extension before the original notification time period has ended.  If you fail to provide the information, your claim will be denied.    If an extension is necessary because Aetna needs more information to process your post service claim, Aetna will notify you and give you an additional period of at least 45 days after receiving the notice to provide the information.  Aetna will then inform you of the claim decision  51  within 15 days after the additional period has ended (or within 15 days after Aetna receives the information, if earlier).  If you fail to provide the information, your claim will be denied.  Payment of Benefits  Benefits will be paid as soon as Aetna receives the necessary proof to support the claim.  All benefits are payable to you.  However, Aetna has the right to pay any benefits directly to your participating providers.  This will be done unless you tell Aetna otherwise by the time you file the claim.  If your claim is denied in whole or in part, you will receive a written notice of the denial from Aetna.  The notice will explain the reason for the denial and the review procedures.

In exercising such fiduciary responsibility, Aetna will have discretionary authority to determine entitlement to plan benefits as determined by the respective plan documents for each claim received and to construe the terms of the plan.  Aetnas decision on any claim is final.  Aetna has complete discretionary authority to review all denied claims for benefits under the plan.  This includes, but is not limited to, determining whether hospital or medical treatment is, or is not, medically necessary.  In exercising its responsibilities, Aetna has discretionary authority to:   Determine whether, and to what extent, you and your covered dependents are entitled to benefits; and  Interpret the provisions of the plan when a question arises.  Aetna has the right to adopt reasonable policies, procedures, rules and interpretations of the plan to promote orderly and efficient administration.  Aetna may not abuse its discretionary authority by acting arbitrarily and capriciously.   Authorized Representative  You may also choose to have another person (an authorized representative) make the appeal on your behalf by providing written consent to Aetna.  In the case of an urgent care claim or a pre-service claim, a physician familiar with the case may represent you in the appeal.  Full and Fair Review of Claim Determinations and Appeals  Aetna will provide you, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by Aetna (or at the direction of Aetna), or any new or additional rationale as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the notice of final internal adverse benefit determination (described below) is provided, to give you a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to that date.  You may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to your claim, whether or not the comments, documents, records or other information were submitted in connection with the initial claim.  A copy of the specific rule, guideline or protocol relied upon in the adverse benefit determination will be provided free of charge upon request by you or your authorized representative.  You may also request that Aetna provide you, free of charge, copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim.  More Information on Urgent Appeals  As noted above, if your claim involves urgent care, an expedited appeal may be initiated by a telephone call to Aetnas Member Services Unit at the toll-free number on your ID card.  All necessary information, including the appeal decision, will be communicated between you or your authorized representative and Aetna by telephone, fascimile, or other similar method.    54   Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination  A final internal adverse benefit determination is an adverse benefit determination that has been upheld by the appropriate claim fiduciary at the completion of the internal appeals process, or an adverse benefit determination for which the internal appeals process has been exhausted.  Exhaustion of Internal Appeals Process  Generally, you must complete all the plans appeal levels before asking for an external review or bringing an action in litigation.  If the level one and level two appeals uphold the original adverse benefit determination for a medical claim, you may have the right to pursue an external review of your claim.   In addition, if Aetna (or the plan or its designee) does not strictly adhere to all claim determination and appeal requirements under applicable federal law, you are considered to have exhausted the plans appeal requirements.  This is known as deemed exhaustion.  When this occurs, you may proceed with external review or pursue any available remedies under 502(a) of ERISA or under state law, as applicable.  Exception:  There is an exception to the deemed exhaustion rule.  You cannot submit your claim or internal appeal directly to external review if the rule violation was:   Minor and not likely to influence a decision or harm you;   For a good cause or was beyond Aetnas or the plans control;   Part of an ongoing good faith exchange between you and Aetna or the plan; and  Not part of a pattern or practice of violations by Aetna or the plan.  If the claims procedures have not been strictly adhered to, you have the right to request a written explanation of the violation from Aetna or the plan.  Within 10 days after receiving your request, Aetna or the plan will give you an explanation of the basis, if any, for asserting that the violation should not cause the internal claim and appeal process to be deemed exhausted.  If an external reviewer or court rejects your request for immediate review on the basis that the plan met the standards for the exception, you have the right to resubmit your claim and pursue the internal appeal of the claim.  External Review   You may file a voluntary appeal for external review of any final appeal determination that qualifies.  An external review is a review of an adverse benefit determination by an external review organization (ERO) or by the State Insurance Commissioner, if applicable.   If you file for a voluntary external review, any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled (suspended) while the appeal is pending.  The filing of a claim will have no effect on your rights to any other benefits under the plan.  However, the appeal is voluntary and you are not required to undertake it before pursuing legal action.       55  Claims That Qualify for External Review  You may request a review by an external review organization (ERO) if:    You have exhausted the plans appeal process; or  Aetna (or the plan or its designee) has not strictly followed all claim determination and appeal requirements under federal law (except for minor violations)  A denial based upon your eligibility is not eligible for external review.  You must complete all of the levels of standard appeal before you can request an external review, except in a case of deemed exhaustion.  Your authorized representative may act on your behalf in filing and pursuing this voluntary appeal, subject to any plan verification procedures.  Deadline for Requesting an External Review  You must submit a written request for external review within 123 calendar days of the date you receive a final denial notice.  If the last filing date would fall on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, the last filing date is extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday.  You also must include a copy of the notice and all other pertinent information that supports your request.  Preliminary Review  Aetna will do a preliminary review of your request for an external review within five days of receiving the request.  The preliminary review determines whether:   You were covered under the plan at the time the service was requested or provided;  The adverse determination does not relate to eligibility;  You have exhausted the internal appeals process (unless deemed exhaustion applies); and  You have provided all paperwork necessary to complete the external review.   Aetna must notify you in writing of the results of the preliminary review within one business day after completing the review.  If your request is complete but not eligible for external review, Aetnas notice will include the reasons why it is not eligible and provide contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (toll-free number 1-866-444-3272).    If the request is not complete, Aetnas notice will describe the information or materials needed to make the request complete.  Aetna must allow you to perfect the request for external review within the 123 calendar days filing period or within the 48-hour period following the receipt of the notification, whichever is later.     56  Referral to ERO  If your request for external review is approved, Aetna will assign an accredited ERO to conduct the review.  The ERO will notify you in writing that your request is eligible and accepted for review, and give you an opportunity to submit additional information that the ERO must consider when conducting the review.  A neutral, independent clinical reviewer, with appropriate expertise in the area in question, will review your material.  The decision of the external reviewer is binding unless otherwise allowed by law.   The ERO will review all of the information and documents received within required time frames. In reaching a decision, the assigned ERO will not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the plans claims and appeals process.  The ERO will consider the following in reaching a decision, as appropriate:   Your medical records;  The attending health care professional's recommendation;  Reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the plan or issuer, you, or your treating provider;  The terms of your plan to ensure that the ERO's decision is not contrary to the terms of the plan, unless the terms are inconsistent with applicable law;  Appropriate practice guidelines, which must include applicable evidence-based standards and may include any other practice guidelines developed by the federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards and associations;  Any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by Aetna, unless the criteria are inconsistent with the terms of the plan or with applicable law; and  The opinion of the ERO's clinical reviewer or reviewers after considering the information described in this notice to the extent the information or documents are available and the clinical reviewer or reviewers consider appropriate.  The assigned ERO must provide written notice of the final decision within 45 days after receiving the request for external review.  The ERO must deliver the final decision to you, Aetna and the plan.  Expedited External Review  The plan must allow you to request an expedited external review at the time you:   Receive an adverse benefit determination, if:  That determination involves a medical condition for which the timeframe for completing an expedited internal appeal (the standard level one and level two appeal process) would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function; and   You have filed a request for an expedited internal appeal; or  Exhaust the internal appeal process (level one and level two), if:  57   You have a medical condition where the timeframe for completing a standard external review would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function; or   It concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which you received emergency services, but have not been discharged from a facility.  As soon as Aetna receives your request for an expedited external review, Aetna will determine whether the request meets the reviewability requirements for standard external review and immediately notify you of its determination.  If your request for an expedited external review is approved, Aetna will assign an ERO.  The ERO will make a decision as quickly as your medical condition or circumstances require, and within 72 hours after the ERO received your request for the expedited review.  If the ERO gives you its decision orally, the ERO must follow up with written confirmation to you, Aetna and the plan within 48 hours of making the decision.  Subrogation and Right of Recovery  If you or your covered dependent receives benefits as the result of an illness or injury, caused by another party, the plan has the right to be reimbursed for those benefits from any settlement or payment you receive from the person who caused the illness or injury.  This process is called subrogation and reimbursement.    Definitions  The description of the subrogation and reimbursement process uses three terms:   third party means any party that is, or may be, or is claimed to be responsible for illness or injuries to you.  Such illness or injuries are referred to as third party injuries.   responsible party includes any party responsible for payment of expenses associated with the care or treatment of third party injuries.   you or your includes anyone on whose behalf this plan pays or provides any benefits.  Right of Recovery  When the plan pays benefits to you for expenses incurred due to third party injuries, then the plan retains the right to repayment of the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan on your behalf that are associated with the third party injuries.  The plans rights of recovery apply to any recoveries made by or on your behalf from the following sources, including but not limited to:   Payments made by a third party or any insurance company on behalf of the third party;  Any payments or awards under an uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage policy;  Any Workers Compensation or disability award or settlement;  Medical payments coverage under any:  58   automobile policy,   premises or homeowners medical payments coverage; or   premises or homeowners insurance coverage; and   Any other payments from a responsible party or another source intended to compensate you for injuries resulting from an accident or alleged negligence.  When You Accept Plan Benefits  By accepting benefits under this plan, you specifically acknowledge the plans right of subrogation.  When this plan pays health care benefits for expenses incurred due to third party injuries, the plan shall be subrogated to your right of recovery against any party to the extent of the full cost of all benefits provided by this plan.  The plan may proceed against any party with or without your consent.  By accepting benefits under this plan, you also specifically acknowledge the plans right of reimbursement.  This right of reimbursement attaches to any payment received by you or your representative from any party responsible for paying for expenses associated with the care or treatment of third party injuries.  By providing any benefit under this plan, the plan is granted an assignment of the proceeds of any settlement, judgment or other payment received by you to the extent of the full cost of all benefits provided by this plan.  The plans right of reimbursement is cumulative with and not exclusive of the plans subrogation right and the plan may choose to exercise either or both rights of recovery.  By accepting benefits under this plan, you or your representatives further agree to:   Notify the claims administrator, Aetna, in writing, within 30 days of the time when notice is given to any party of the intention to investigate or pursue a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to third party injuries sustained by you;  Cooperate with Aetna and its designees and do whatever is necessary to secure the plans rights of subrogation and reimbursement under this document;  Give the plan a first-priority lien on any recovery, settlement, or judgment or other source of compensation which may be had from any party to the extent of the full cost of all benefits associated with third party injuries provided by this plan (regardless of whether specifically set forth in the recovery, settlement, judgment or compensation agreement);  Pay, as the first priority, from any recovery, settlement judgment, or other source of compensation, any and all amounts due to the plan as reimbursement for the full cost of all benefits associated with third party injuries paid by this plan (regardless of whether specifically set forth in the recovery, settlement, judgment, or compensation agreement), unless otherwise agreed to by Aetna in writing;   Do nothing to prejudice the plans rights as set forth above. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery which specifically attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits paid by the plan; and  Serve as a constructive trustee for the benefits of this plan over any settlement or recovery funds received as a result of third party injuries.  The plans recovery rights under this provision are first priority rights and the plan is entitled to reimbursement even if such reimbursement results in a recovery to you that is insufficient to  59  compensate you in whole or in part for your damages from a third party injury.  The plan may recover the full cost of all benefits paid by this plan without regard to any claim of fault on your part, whether by comparative negligence or otherwise.  No court costs or attorney fees may be deducted from the plans recovery, and the plan and claim administrator are not required to pay or contribute to paying court costs or attorneys fees for the attorney hired by you to pursue your claim or lawsuit against any third party without the prior express written consent of the claims administrator.    In the event you or your representative fail to cooperate with the plan and its claims administrator, you shall be responsible for all benefits paid by this plan in addition to costs and attorneys fees incurred by the plan and its claims administrator in obtaining repayment.  Complaints  The plan has procedures for you to follow if you are dissatisfied with the service you receive from the plan or you want to complain about an in-network provider.  To make a complaint about an operational issue or the quality of care youve received, you must write to Member Services within 30 days of the incident.  Include a detailed description of the matter and include copies of any records or documents that you think are relevant.  Aetna will review the information and give you a written decision within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the complaint, unless additional information is needed, but cannot be obtained within this time frame.  The notice of the decision will tell you what you need to do to seek an additional review.  Recovery of Overpayment  If Aetna makes a benefit payment over the amount that you are entitled to under this plan, Aetna has the right to:   Require that the overpayment be returned on request; or  Reduce any future benefit payment by the amount of the overpayment.  This right does not affect any other right of overpayment recovery Aetna may have.  Legal Action  No legal action can be brought to recover a benefit after 3 years from the deadline for filing claims.    Aetna will not try to reduce or deny a benefit payment on the grounds that a condition existed before a persons coverage went into effect, as long as the loss occurs more than 2 years from the date coverage started.  This will not apply to any condition that is not covered as of the date of the loss.    60  THE APPEAL PROCESS FOR CVS CAREMARK  First Level Appeals  Requests for appeal must be made in writing within 180 days from receipt of adverse benefit participation by the participant or his/her representative (e.g., physician).

Reasonable and Customary Charge The reasonable and customary charge for a covered service or supply is the lower of:  The providers usual charge for providing it;   69   The charge Aetna determines to be appropriate, based on factors such as the cost of providing the same or similar service or supply; and the way charges for the service or supply are made, billed or coded.  For non-facility charges, Aetna uses the 90th percentile of charges as reported in a database of charges that Aetna receives from a third party.  Aetna may contribute information to that third party that is used in assembling the database.  For facility charges, Aetna uses the charge Aetna determines to be the usual charge level for the service in the geographic area where the service is furnished.  Aetna may reduce the reasonable and customary charge to address the appropriate billing of services, taking into account factors such as:  The duration and complexity of a service;  Whether multiple procedures are billed at the same time, but no additional overhead is required;  Whether an assistant surgeon is involved and necessary for the service;   Whether follow-up care is included;  Whether there are any other factors that modify or make the service unique; and  Whether any services are part of or incidental to the primary service provided if the charge includes more than one claim line.  Aetnas reimbursement policies are based on:  Aetnas review of policies developed for Medicare;  Generally accepted standards of medical and dental practice; and  The views of physicians and dentists practicing in the relevant clinical areas.  Aetna uses a commercial software package to administer some of these policies.

If you do not agree with such determination, you have the right to file a second request for review.  External Review Aetna may deny a claim because it determines that the care is not appropriate or a service or treatment is experimental or investigational in nature.  In either of these situations, you may request an external review if you or your provider disagrees with Aetnas decision.  An external review is a review by an independent physician, selected by an External Review Organization, who has expertise in the problem or question involved.  To request an external review, the following requirements must be met:   You have received notice of the denial of a claim by Aetna; and  Your claim was denied because Aetna determined that the care was not necessary or was experimental or investigational; and  The cost of the service or treatment in question for which you are responsible exceeds $ 500; and  You have exhausted the applicable internal Appeal processes.  The claim denial letter you receive from Aetna will describe the process to follow if you wish to pursue an external review, including a copy of the Request for External Review Form.  You must submit the Request for External Review Form to Aetna within 60 calendar days of the date you received the final claim denial letter.  You also must include a copy of the final claim denial letter and all other pertinent information that supports your request.  Aetna will contact the External Review Organization that will conduct the review of your claim.  The External Review Organization will select an independent physician with appropriate expertise to perform the review.  In making a decision, the external reviewer may consider any appropriate credible information that you send along with the Request for External Review Form, and will follow Aetnas contractual documents and plan criteria governing the benefits.  You will be notified of the decision of the External Review Organization usually within 30 calendar days of Aetnas receipt of your request form and all necessary information.  A quicker review is possible if your physician certifies (by telephone or on a separate Request for External Review Form) that a delay in receiving the service would endanger your health.  Expedited reviews are decided within 3 to 5 calendar days after Aetna receives the request.  Aetna will abide by the decision of the External Review Organization, except where Aetna can show conflict of interest, bias or fraud.  You are responsible for the cost of compiling and sending the information that you wish to be reviewed by the External Review Organization to Aetna.  Aetna is responsible for the cost of sending this information to the External Review Organization and for the cost of the external review.  For more information about the External Review process, call the toll-free Customer Services telephone number shown on your ID card.       Exhaustion of Process You must exhaust the applicable Level One and Level Two processes of the Appeal Procedure before you:   contact your U.S. state's Department of Insurance to request an investigation of a complaint or Appeal; or  file a complaint or Appeal with your state's Department of Insurance; or  establish any:  litigation;  arbitration; or  administrative proceeding;  regarding an alleged breach of the policy terms by Aetna Life Insurance Company, acting on behalf of Aetna Life & Casualty (Bermuda) Ltd.; or any matter within the scope of the Appeals Procedure.

Payment limits apply per individual on a calendar year basis. Only those out-of-pocket expenses resulting from the application of a payment percentage may be used to satisfy the payment limit. Deductibles, copays, benefit penalties and 50% items are excluded from the payment limit.  There is cross-application between calendar year deductible, out of pocket maximum and lifetime maximum across overseas, in-network and out-of network level of benefits.   Coverage maximums up to a certain number of days/visits per calendar year are reached by combining the Preferred and Non-Preferred benefits up to the limit for either one plan or the other, but not both. (Example, if the Preferred benefit is for 120 days and the Non-Preferred benefit is for 120 days, the maximum benefit is 120 days, not 240 days).  Maternity expenses are covered as any other medical expense. Coverage is provided for an employee and spouse and all female family members Pregnancy benefits do not continue to be payable after coverage ends except in the event of total disability.  For contracted hospitals, the non-contracted Radiologist, Anesthesiologist and Pathologist (RAPS) are paid at the preferred level, and will be subject to reasonable and customary charges. Note that this payment method may apply to other providers.  Benefit maximums per Calendar year are calculated between 01/01/2019 and 12/31/2019.  Copayments and coinsurance for chiropractic visits are capped at 25% of the amount due to the chiropractor.    Other Health Care (Out-of-Area):  When care is provided in the U.S. in a geographic area in which Aetna has not contracted with a provider, charges are payable at 90% after any applicable Deductible (does not apply to those expenses paid at a reduced payment percentage). The benefit levels associated with the following In-Network provisions would apply: Deductible, Family Deductible, Inpatient Hospital Deductible, Out of-pocket maximum(s).  *This plan includes coverage under the extent required in accordance with the Federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) beginning with plan years starting on or after January 1, 2018.  **  Payment for Non-Preferred Providers We cover the cost of care differently based on whether health care providers, such as doctors and hospitals, are \"in network\" or \"out of network.\" We want to help you understand how much Aetna pays for your out-of-network care. At the same time, we want to make it clear how much more you will need to pay for this out-of-network care.  As an example, you may choose a doctor in our network. You may choose to visit an out-of-network doctor. If you choose a doctor who is out of network, your Aetna health plan may pay some of that doctor's bill. Most of the time, you will pay a lot more money out of your own pocket if you choose to use an out-of-network doctor or hospital.  When you choose out-of-network care, Aetna limits the amount it will pay. This limit is called the \"recognized\" or \"allowed\" amount. When you choose out-of-network care, Aetna \"recognizes\" an amount based on what Medicare pays for these services. The government sets the Medicare rate. Exactly how much Aetna \"recognizes\" depends on the plan you or your employer picks.                Group Insurance Plan of Benefits for           Sherwin-Williams (Control #620605)        administered by Aetna International        Effective Date: January 1, 2019  Note: This is not evidence of coverage. You must enroll and be accepted for coverage with the Coverage Administrator before benefits described in this document will be effective. In the case of a discrepancy between the Plan Documents and this document, the Plan Documents will determine the Plan of Benefits. As used herein, the term \"Plan Documents\" includes, but is not limited to, the Booklet, Summary of Coverage and any Booklet Amendments/Riders including any state-specific variations, as applicable. For further details, refer to your Plan Documents.   6 10/23/2018 Your out-of-network doctor sets the rate to charge you. It may be higher -- sometimes much higher -- than what your Aetna plan \"recognizes\" or \"allows.\" Your doctor may bill you for the dollar amount that Aetna doesn't recognize. You must also pay any copayments, coinsurance and deductibles under your plan. No dollar amount above the recognized charge counts toward your deductible or maximum out-of-pocket. To learn more about how we pay out-of-network benefits visit Aetna.com. Type \"how Aetna pays\" in the search box.  You can avoid these extra costs by getting your care from Aetna's broad network of health care providers. Go to www.aetna.com and click on \"Find a Doctor\" on the left side of the page. If you are already a member, sign on to your Aetna Navigator member site.   This way of paying out-of-network doctors and hospitals applies when you choose to get care out of network.  When you have no choice (for example: emergency room visit after a car accident), we will pay the bill as if you got care in network. You pay your plan's copayments, coinsurance and deductibles for your in-network level of benefits. Contact Aetna if your provider asks you to pay more. You are not responsible for any outstanding balance billed by your providers for emergency services beyond your copayments, coinsurance and deductibles.

Usted puede invertir en una o ms de las opciones de inversin del Plan, que incluyen una variedad de fondos del mercado monetario, de renta fija y de valores accionarios.  Cambios de inversin...  Su cuenta se valora al final de cada da hbil, lo que significa que, por lo general, usted puede cambiar su combinacin de inversiones tan frecuentemente como diariamente.  Flexibilidad... Cuando se jubila, usted puede optar por recibir su cuenta en una sola suma global o pagada directamente a usted.  Alternativamente, usted puede transferir el saldo de su Plan a otro tipo de plan calificado o a una cuenta de jubilacin individual (Individual Retirement Account, IRA).

Fondos para la jubilacin con fecha prevista El plan ofrece fondos de jubilacin con fecha prevista, o TDF por sus siglas en ingls, como una opcin de inversin para los empleados que no desean gestionar activamente sus ahorros para la jubilacin.  Los TDF se re-equilibran automticamente para ser ms conservadores a medida que el empleado se acerca a la jubilacin.  La fecha prevista se refiere a una fecha de jubilacin prevista, que con frecuencia es parte del nombre del fondo.  Los fondos TDF ofrecen una estrategia a largo plazo basada en la tenencia de una combinacin de acciones, bonos y otras inversiones (esta combinacin es llamada asignacin de activos) que cambia automticamente a lo largo del tiempo a medida que el participante avanza en edad.  La asignacin de activos inicial de un fondo TDF, cuando la fecha prevista est a una cantidad de aos de distancia, por lo general, consiste en su mayora de acciones o inversiones de capital, que, a menudo, tienen mayor potencial para obtener rendimientos ms altos, pero tambin pueden ser ms voltiles y conllevar un mayor riesgo de inversin.  Como se acerca la fecha de jubilacin objetivo, la asignacin de activos del fondo cambia para incluir una mayor proporcin de inversiones ms conservadoras, como bonos e instrumentos de efectivo, que en general son menos voltiles y llevan menos riesgo de la inversin que las acciones.  Como se mencion anteriormente, si usted no proporciona instrucciones de inversin para las cantidades que aporta al Plan, de forma predeterminada, sus aportaciones se invertirn automticamente en un fondo TDF basado en el ao en que usted cumpla 65 aos de edad.      9  CMO SE VALORA SU CUENTA  Su cuenta se valora al final de cada da hbil en que los mercados financieros estn abiertos.

En particular, hay normas tributarias especiales en Puerto Rico que afectan a su distribucin.

Si su cuenta total se distribuye dentro de un solo ao gravable debido a su separacin del servicio o de la terminacin del plan (una distribucin total), el importe de la distribucin total se considera ganancia de capital a largo plazo sujeta a un impuesto del 20%.

Cumplimiento de la Seccin 404(c)   El Plan est diseado para cumplir con la Seccin 404(c) de la Ley de Seguridad de Ingresos de Jubilacin de los Empleados (ERISA) de 1974.  La Seccin 404(c) les proporciona a los fiduciarios del Plan cierto alivio de la responsabilidad por prdidas que sean el resultado directo y necesario de instrucciones de inversin de los participantes, siempre que los fiduciarios les hayan presentado opciones de inversin e informacin razonables y adecuadas a los participantes.  Debido a que usted dirige cmo se invierten las aportaciones a sus cuentas (incluyendo el uso de determinados fondos de inversin predeterminados calificados, tales como fondos combinados de ciclo de vida, sobre los cuales ha recibido informacin), los fiduciarios del Plan que, de otro modo, seran responsables en virtud de las normas federales por dirigir las inversiones son relevados de esta responsabilidad con respecto a tales aportaciones.  Como resultado, los fiduciarios no son responsables ante la ley por ninguna prdida de sus cuentas que sean el resultado directo y necesario de sus instrucciones de inversin.  Los fiduciarios siguen siendo responsables, sin embargo, de proporcionarle diversas oportunidades de inversin y oportunidades suficientes para dirigir la inversin de su cuenta.  Usted no puede ceder su cuenta El Plan no permite que usted o su beneficiario asignen, enajenen, vendan, transfieran ni prometan beneficios del Plan a un acreedor o cualquier otra persona, ni ninguna persona puede crear un gravamen sobre ninguna de los fondos, valores u otros bienes en poder del Plan.  Estas disposiciones no se aplican, sin embargo, en los casos de ciertas rdenes del tribunal con respecto a relaciones domsticas calificadas, que crean derechos a los beneficios del Plan para cnyuges, ex cnyuges, hijos u otras personas a cargo de los participantes.

El Administrador del Plan tiene la facultad de dirigir el pago de los gastos administrativos imputables a la cuenta de un participante a dicha cuenta, incluyendo por ejemplo los costos inherentes a la gestin de los activos de un fondo de inversin.  Estos gastos pueden incluir elementos tales como la revisin de rdenes de relaciones domsticas.

Participantes o beneficiarios faltantes Si deja el empleo de la Compaa, es su responsabilidad informar al fiduciario del Plan sobre cualquier cambio en su direccin.  Los cambios de direccin de los empleados que terminan su empleo se pueden hacer ponindose en contacto con el encargado del servicio de registros del Plan al 1-800-323-4015.

Orden calificada de relaciones domsticas  Si, como resultado de un divorcio, usted es responsable de la manutencin de menores, pensin alimenticia o pagos de derechos de propiedad maritales, la totalidad o parte de sus beneficios del Plan pueden ser asignados para cumplir con estos pagos si una orden de relaciones domsticas calificada, (que el Administrador del Plan determine que cumple con los trminos del Plan) ha sido dictada por un tribunal.  Los participantes y beneficiarios pueden obtener, sin cargo, copias de dichos procedimientos del Administrador del Plan.  Normas para planes de altos cargos Las normas para planes de altos cargos imponen restricciones legales adicionales sobre los planes de beneficios para empleados tributariamente calificados, en los que ms del 60% de los beneficios vayan a empleados clave (ciertos gerentes y empleados altamente remunerados).  Si un plan es para altos cargos, las restricciones especiales incluyen disposiciones de determinados beneficios mnimos y de adquisicin de derechos.

El Plan podr ser rescindido por accin de la Junta Directiva de la Compaa.

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  Los beneficios bajo este Plan no estn garantizados por la Pension Benefit Guaranty     20 Corporation (PBGC) debido a que el Plan es un plan de aportacin definida no sujeto a la cobertura de la PBGC, y las cuentas del Plan se financian en su totalidad.   DERECHOS BAJO LA LEY ERISA   Recibir informacin sobre su Plan y sus beneficios En 1974, el Congreso aprob la Ley de Seguridad de Ingresos de Jubilacin de los Empleados (ERISA) de 1974 para salvaguardar los intereses de los participantes y beneficiarios de los planes de beneficios para empleados.

UU. y disponible al pblico en el saln de informacin de la Administracin de Seguridad de Beneficios del Empleado;  obtener copias, previa solicitud por escrito al Administrador del Plan, de todos los documentos del Plan que rigen la operacin del Plan, y copias del ltimo informe anual (Formulario serie 5500) y de la SPD actualizada.

Esta declaracin debe ser solicitada por escrito y no se requiere que sea proporcionada ms de una vez cada 12 meses.  El Plan debe proporcionar la declaracin de forma gratuita;   Accin prudente por parte de los fiduciarios del Plan Adems de crear derechos para los participantes del Plan, la ley ERISA impone obligaciones a las personas que son responsables de la operacin del Plan.  Las personas que operan su Plan, llamados fiduciarios del Plan, tienen el deber de hacerlo prudentemente y en el inters de  usted y de los dems participantes y beneficiarios del Plan.  Nadie, incluido su empleador, su sindicato o cualquier otra persona, puede despedirlo o discriminarlo de alguna manera para impedir que obtenga un beneficio o ejerza sus derechos bajo la ley ERISA.  Haga valer sus derechos Si su reclamacin de un beneficio es denegada en su totalidad o en parte, usted debe recibir una explicacin por escrito de las razones de la denegacin, puede obtener copias de los documentos relacionados con la decisin, sin cargo alguno, y tiene derecho a que el Administrador del Plan revise y reconsidere su reclamacin, todo dentro de ciertos plazos.        21 Bajo la ley ERISA, hay pasos que usted puede dar para hacer valer los derechos arriba mencionados. Por ejemplo, si usted solicita por escrito una copia de los documentos del Plan o del ltimo informe anual del Plan y no lo recibe dentro de los 30 das, puede presentar una demanda en un tribunal federal.  En tal caso, el tribunal podr exigir al Administrador del Plan que le proporcione los materiales solicitados y le pague hasta $110 por da hasta que reciba dichos materiales, a menos que estos no se hayan enviado por razones ajenas a la voluntad del Administrador del Plan.  Si usted tiene una reclamacin de beneficios que se rechaza o se omite, en su totalidad o en parte, puede presentar una demanda en un tribunal estatal o federal.   Adems, si est en desacuerdo con la decisin del Plan o la falta de una decisin en cuanto al estado calificado de una orden de relaciones domsticas, puede presentar una demanda en un tribunal federal.    Si sucediera que los fiduciarios del Plan hicieran uso indebido del dinero del Plan o si se le discrimina a usted por hacer valer sus derechos, puede solicitar la asistencia del Departamento de Trabajo de EE. UU. o puede presentar una demanda en un tribunal federal. El tribunal decidir quin debe pagar los costos judiciales y honorarios legales.  Si usted tiene xito, el tribunal puede ordenar a la persona que usted demand que pague estos costos y honorarios. Si usted pierde, el tribunal puede ordenar que usted pague estos costos y honorarios; por ejemplo, si encuentra que su reclamacin es frvola.

The Plan is a money purchase pension plan which The Sherwin-Williams Company (Sherwin-Williams or the Company) maintains to provide retirement benefits for  certain eligible employees of the Company (Eligible Employees).  The benefits provided under the Plan are in addition to other benefits the Company provides, and along with Social Security may be an important source of income at your retirement.  This summary describes the provisions of the Plan as in effect on January 1, 2015, for participants employed by the Company on and after that date.  Plan details for participants separating from employment prior to that date may be different.  This Summary Plan Description (SPD) is a summary of important provisions contained in the Plan document.  More detailed information is contained in the Plan document, which governs in the case of any discrepancies.  You may obtain a copy of the Plan document from the Employee Benefits Service Center.  The Recordkeeper for the Plan is Fidelity Management Trust Company (Recordkeeper).  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PLAN  You Do Not Make Contributions...  The Company makes all contributions to this Plan on your behalf (meet the eligibility requirements discussed later).  By meeting the eligibility and allocation requirements, you are automatically enrolled in this Plan and eligible for the annual contribution.  Investment Choices...  You choose how your contributions to the Plan are invested.  You can invest in one or more of the Plans investment options, which include a variety of money market, fixed income and equity funds.  Investment Changes...  Your account is valued at the end of every business day, which means you can generally change your investment mix as frequently as daily.  Flexibility... When you retire, you may choose to receive your account in a single lump-sum or paid directly to you.  Alternatively, you can rollover your Plan balance to another qualified plan arrangement or an individual retirement account (IRA).  You can also choose to have various forms of life annuities purchased for you by the Plan.    If you leave the Company before you retire and you are vested in your account balance, these same choices are available.  In either case, you have the flexibility to choose how your account is distributed.  Tax Advantage... You will not pay income taxes on Company contributions, or any earnings until you begin receiving a distribution of your account.      4  24 hour Access... You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to get information about your account, to change your investment elections, to transfer (exchange) funds, to request information about the investment options, and to request a total distribution from the Plan once you are eligible for such a distribution (i.e., upon your termination of employment).  ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN  As an employee of the Company, to become eligible to participate in the Plan you must:   be hired (with employment commencing) prior to January 1, 2002, or be hired (with employment commencing) on or after October 1, 2011,  be an employee (either full-time or part-time) of the Company or a subsidiary of the  Company which has adopted the Plan and in a group to which coverage under the Plan has been extended by the Company,  not be a member of a collective bargaining unit unless eligibility for the Plan is extended to such members through negotiation, and  be employed in the United States or be a citizen of the United States if you are working abroad, under certain circumstances described in the Plan.  You begin participation in the Plan when you have completed 6 months of service with the Company.  Once you become eligible to participate in the Plan, you will be sent an information package and copy of this SPD.  This package provides you with additional information on both the Plan and how to direct the Companys contribution to your account into the various investments offered.  Please note that on December 31, 2001 the Plan was frozen to new members, and effective October 1, 2011, the Plan was re-opened to new hires and former employees who are rehired.  That means that for anyone hired or re-hired after December 31, 2001 and before October 1, 2011, they generally are not be eligible for the Plan (but may be eligible for another retirement program offered by the Company).  However, effective October 1, 2011, the Plan was re-opened to new hires and former employees who are rehired.  For participants who terminate employment and are later re-employed, special rules (called Break in Service Rules) apply.  Contact the Employee Benefits Service Center if you have questions relating to participation upon re-employment.  VESTING  Vesting gives you ownership of the money in your account, which means that you can take your vested account balance with you when you leave the Company.    You earn vesting on the Company contributions to your account, based on accumulating 1,000 hours of service in a Plan year.  You receive one year of vesting service (regardless of when you join the Plan) for each calendar year you are credited with 1,000 hours of     5 service with the Company.  If you are actively employed by the Company you become 100% vested in the Company contributions once you earn three (3) vesting years in the Plan.  There is no partial vesting; if you leave the Company before earning three vesting years in the Plan, you forfeit your entire account balance, unless your termination of employment is due to your death or your retirement under the Plan (then you become 100% vested in the Company contributions upon your termination of employment).   Forfeitures If you leave the Company before you become fully vested in your Company contributions, you will not be entitled to receive the unvested portion of your Company contributions.  The unvested portion of your Company contributions will be forfeited immediately after you leave the Company.  If you leave the Company, then later become re-employed by the Company, you may be entitled to a reinstatement of the forfeited portion of your Account, depending on several factors as outlined in the Plan document.  Contact the Employee Benefits Service Center if you have questions relating to re-employment participation, and whether any previous forfeitures are eligible for reinstatement.  CONTRIBUTIONS  All contributions to your account are made by the Company.  You cannot make contributions to your Plan account.  You are eligible for a Company contribution each Plan year if:   you met the participation requirement,  you have met the eligibility requirements, as previously discussed,  you complete at least 1,000 hours of service during the Plan year, and  you are employed by the Company on the last day of the Plan year.  You may also be eligible for a contribution during the Plan year in which you a) are eligible to retire, or b) die (and are vested in your account balance).  Special rules also apply to you if you terminated from employment during the year and were subsequently rehired (in which case you may not be eligible for a Company contribution that year), or if you transferred between positions during the Plan year.  Contact the Employee Benefits Service Center if you have specific questions about these special circumstances.    Company Contributions If you are eligible for a Plan year contribution as described above, the Company will contribute to your account an amount based on a percentage of your earnings.  The contribution percentage is based on the sum of your age and years of service with the Company determined on the last day of the year.  The following table illustrates how your contribution percentage is derived:    If your combination of     Your   Age and Service years    Contribution   is between:      Percent is:     6   18  and 34.9     2.0%   35 and 44.9     2.5%   45 and 54.9     3.0%   55 and 64.9     3.5%   65 and 74.9     4.0%   75 and 84.9     5.0%   85 and 94.9     6.0%   95 and up      7.0%  Your earnings generally include the compensation reported on your annual W-2 form, with the following adjustments:   increased for pre-tax contributions you make to the Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) or for pre-tax health care charges, and   decreased by tuition aid, moving expenses, stock option or restricted stock income, separation pay and any other pay designated as non-creditable by the Company.  The Company contribution will generally be deposited to your account no later than the last business day of March following the Plan year for which you qualify for the contribution.   Rollover Contributions You cannot make a rollover contribution from another qualified plan, such as a prior employer plan, to this Plan.  Maximum Company Contributions The IRS limits the maximum contributions that can be made to defined contribution plans of the Company each calendar year to the lesser of $53,000 (for 2015, which is subject to an annual adjustment) or 100% of your compensation.    INVESTMENTS  The funds that are contributed to the Plan on your behalf are held in a trust by the Plans Trustee, Fidelity Management Trust Company (the Trustee).  The Trustee must hold the Plans trust fund assets for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries.    Investment Direction You are permitted to direct the investments of the funds deposited to your Account among the various investment options offered by the Plan.  You do not need to fill out a form to direct the investment of your Account.  To make this direction, log on to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  You may revoke or change your directions the same way.  For a complete list of investment options available within the Plan, including fees and expenses, log on to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and ask for free prospectuses.  Read them carefully before you make your investment choices.  The list of funds may change from time to time.   When you first direct the investment of the Companys contribution to your Account, you     7 will:   establish a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be used to access your account in the future, and  choose how you want to invest your own contributions.  You can make changes to your account on a daily basis through the Recordkeepers Voice Response System, or by speaking directly to a service representative any business day between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 12:00 Midnight, or by logging on to www.401k.com.  Transaction requests received after 4 p.m. Eastern time or on weekends or holidays will receive the next business days closing price.  If you do not direct the investments of your Company contribution, your contribution account will be automatically invested in the Plans default fund.  The Plans default fund will consist of a target date retirement fund, or TDF, that closely matches your retirement date based on a projected retirement age of 65.  For more information, please see the Target Date Retirement Funds discussion under INVESTMENT OPTIONS in this document.  This default fund may not provide the most appropriate level of risk versus reward for your particular circumstances, so evaluating and selecting your investments is extremely important.  As noted above, you can always change your investment direction, including exchanging previously contributed funds, on any business day by logging on to www.401k.com or calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  Sherwin-Williams makes no guarantees or assurances regarding the performance of any investment option.  The value of a participants account will ultimately be determined by the investment results of the investment fund(s) in which a participants account has been invested.  The value of such account is not protected against loss.  Investment Committee The Fund Review and Management Committee (the Committee) selects and reviews the investment options from which you may choose.  The members of the Committee are fiduciaries of the Plan.  The Company intends that the Plan qualifies under Section 404(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, which means that participants will be liable for losses that are the direct result of their own investment decisions.  See the Additional Information section for further details.  INVESTMENT OPTIONS  The investment options offered by the Plan have different investment objectives, allowing you to choose which investment options present the level of risk versus reward you feel is appropriate for your financial goals.  More information regarding the investment objectives of the various investment options, as well as the fees and expenses associated with each available investment option, is available at www.401k.com or by calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and requesting free fund prospectuses.  The different investment options provide a range of risk, liquidity, and investment return opportunities.  No one, including the Company or the Recordkeeper, recommends any investment over the other.  You will need to assess what investments meet your objectives.  Your selection of options should take into account your personal financial situation, including your total assets and investments both inside and outside the Plan and how long you intend to have the funds invested.     8   Target Date Retirement Funds The Plan offers target date retirement funds, or TDFs, as an investment option for employees who do not want to actively manage their retirement savings.  TDFs automatically rebalance to become more conservative as an employee gets closer to retirement.  The target date refers to a target retirement date, and often is part of the name of the fund.  TDFs offer a long-term strategy based on holding a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments (this mix is called an asset allocation) that automatically changes over time as the participant ages.  A TDFs initial asset allocation, when the target date is a number of years away, usually consists mostly of stocks or equity investments, which often have greater potential for higher returns but also can be more volatile and carry greater investment risk.  As the target retirement date approaches, the fund's asset allocation shifts to include a higher proportion of more conservative investments, like bonds and cash instruments, which generally are less volatile and carry less investment risk than stocks.  As mentioned earlier, if you do not provide an investment direction for amounts you contribute to the Plan, as a default your contributions will be automatically invested in a TDF based on the year you will reach age 65.  HOW YOUR ACCOUNT IS VALUED  Your account is valued at the end of every business day the financial markets are open. You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a current account balance.  Account Statements Statements are always available on line at www.401k.com.  If you elect to receive paper statements, you will receive a statement at the end of each quarter showing your balance at the beginning of the quarter, the account activity during that quarter and an ending balance for the quarter. Your statement will be sent to you within a reasonable time after the close of the quarter.  YOUR BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION  It is essential that you establish one or more beneficiaries to receive your account balance in the Plan in case of your death.  Log on to www.401k.com, click on the Your Profile tab, and then click Beneficiaries.  Follow the step-by-step instructions to designate your beneficiary.  If you do not have internet access, you can call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a beneficiary form.    If you do not designate your beneficiary your vested retirement benefits will be distributed to your eligible spouse or, if single, to your estate.  If you are married, the Plan will automatically purchase a survivor annuity with your vested account balance that will be immediately payable to your spouse on a monthly basis (the default benefit payment).  However, for benefit payments that have not started as of January 1, 2010, in the event of your death before commencement your eligible spouse may elect an optional form of benefit in lieu of any election form on file.  Similarly, if you are not married your beneficiary may elect an optional form of benefit as permitted by the Plan.     9  Please remember, as events in your life change over time you can always update your beneficiary elections by logging on to www.401k.com or calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a new form.  DOMESTIC PARTNERS  If you have a domestic partner, under the Plan you will be treated as married, and your domestic partner will be generally treated as a spouse.  If you do not name a beneficiary and you have a domestic partner, your domestic partner will be your beneficiary.  For purposes of the Plan, a domestic partner means (1) a person (of the same-sex or opposite-sex) with whom you have a current valid domestic partnership registration, civil union certificate, or similar document from any state or local government agency authorized to perform such a registration or civil union, or (2) if no valid partnership registration, civil union certificate, or similar document exists from any state, a person (of the same-sex or opposite-sex) in a relationship with you where you:   Have lived together for at least one year;  Are both age 18 years or older and mentally competent to enter into a legal contract;  Are both in an exclusive relationship  Are both not married to anyone else;  Are both not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the state;  Share the same regular and permanent residence with the current intent of doing so indefinitely;  Are financially interdependent on each other which financial interdependence may be subject to documentation in accordance with procedures established by the Plans Administration Committee (Administration Committee), to the extent consistent with pertinent law; and  Were mentally competent to enter into the relationship at the time when the domestic partnership began.  Please note that for purposes of Plan rollover rules, under federal tax law your domestic partner is not treated as a spouse.  Similarly, your domestic partner is not treated as a spouse for purposes of tax rules relating to required minimum distributions following your death.  Please note that effective June 26, 2013, if you are married to a person of the same sex in a marriage validly entered into in a state whose laws authorize the marriage of two persons of the same sex, you are married for all Plan and tax purposes, and the domestic partner provisions described above do not apply.  CHANGES TO EMPLOYMENT STATUS  Your level of participation in the Plan will depend on your employment status.  If You Retire If you retire from the Company, you will elect a distribution option offered in the Plan.  Refer to the Retirement Distribution section of this SPD for further details.   If You Terminate Employment If you leave the Company for any reason other than retirement after you become vested,     10 the value of your account will automatically be distributed in accordance with the law if the total value is $5,000 or less.  If $1,000 or less, such balance will be paid to you in a single payment.  If greater than $1,000 (but $5,000 or less), and you do not otherwise elect, then the distribution shall be paid in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the Plans Administration Committee.  Account balances above $5,000 will remain in the Plan and will require your consent before your account can be distributed1.  If you do not call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and request a distribution of your vested account, you will continue to be a Plan participant subject to the following:   you will be eligible to change investment options;  you can request a full distribution of your vested account any time;  you will be required to take a minimum distribution each year after you attain age 70 ; and  your vested account will be distributed to your named beneficiary or estate if you die prior to taking a full distribution.  If You Are on a Leave of Absence If you are on an authorized leave of absence, you will continue to accrue hours of service up to one year of service for hours for which you are directly or indirectly paid, except that no more than 501 hours of service shall be credited for a single continuous period in which you perform no duties.  While you are on leave of absence you cannot request a distribution of your vested account balance. If you are on a military leave of absence, special rules may apply.  However, while you are on a leave of absence you can continue to transfer funds among the Plans investment options and/or change your investment direction.  While on leave of absence you will continue to be a Plan participant subject to the following:   you will be eligible to change investment options; and  your vested account will be distributed to your named beneficiary should you die prior to taking a full distribution.  OBTAINING A DISTRIBUTION FROM YOUR ACCOUNT  Retirement Distributions You are eligible to retire from the Company if:  you are 65 years old (the Plans normal retirement age);  you are at least 55 years old, and you have at least 20 years of service;   OR  you are at least 60 years old or older, and the sum of your age and years of service with the Company equals at least 75 (for example: you are 60 years old and you have 15 years of Service, or you are age 62 with 13 years of Service).  To apply for retirement benefits, contact the Employee Benefits Service Center 90 days prior to your anticipated retirement date to request a retirement package.  The retirement package will include a Pension Option Election Form and an Explanation of Payment Options that describes the distribution options that are available.  The distributions                                                  1 Plan participants who choose to leave their account balances in the Plan may be assessed a small recordkeeping fee equal to the cost the Company would otherwise pay for the participant as an active employee.     11 options are:   Joint & Survivor Annuity (either 50%, 75% or 100%),  Single Life Annuity, or  One Payment (Lump Sum).  If you elect a Joint & Survivor Annuity option, estimates will be provided to you as to the amount you (and your spouse) can expect to receive on a monthly basis from the annuity for your lifetimes.  The purchase price of the Joint & Survivor Annuity will be the full balance of your vested account at the time of the purchase.  If you wish to waive the Joint & Survivor Annuity options and choose one of the other Retirement options available (and you are married at the time you retire), your spouse must consent to this waiver by signing the Spouse Consent Statement on page two of the Pension Option Election Form.  Your spouses signature must be witnessed by a Notary Public.   If you elect the Single Life Annuity option, you will receive estimates of the amount that will be paid from the annuity to you monthly for your lifetime.  The purchase price of the Single Life Annuity will be the full balance of your vested account at the time of the purchase.  This type of annuity will pay you for your lifetime, but if you should die before the full purchase price has been paid to you, the beneficiary(s) you designated will receive a lump sum amount of the difference of what you received from this annuity type and the initial purchase price of the annuity.  If you are married at the time of retirement, and elect the Single Life Annuity option,  the Spouse Consent Statement on page two of the Pension Option Election Form must be completed and your spouses signature must be witnessed by a Plan Representative or Notary Public.   If you elect the One Payment option, you have two choices of distribution:   you can elect a direct rollover of your funds to another qualified plan (or IRA), OR  you can elect to have your entire account balance paid direct to you.   Please note, you may split the distribution as a) part direct rollover, and b) part paid cash to you, with the cash portion subject to mandatory 20% federal tax withholding.  In January of the year following your distribution, you will receive a Form 1099-R from this distribution to file with your Federal Income Tax Return.  If you are married at the time you retire, and you elect the One Payment option, the Spouse Consent Statement on page two of the Pension Option Election Form must be completed and your spouses signature must be witnessed by a Plan Representative or Notary Public.    Termination of Employment If you terminate your employment from the Company for any reason (other than retirement or death) and you are 100% vested in your account balance, you may call the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to request a full distribution from the Plan.  If you are married, this distribution will require you to waive the 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity Option of distribution, and your spouse will need to consent to this lump sum distribution by signing a distribution form and having his/her signature notarized.  When electing a lump sum distribution, you have two choices of distribution:   you can elect a direct rollover of a cash distribution to a qualified plan or IRA arrangement.  There will be no taxes deducted for this direct rollover, or     12  you can have the distribution paid directly to you.  This type of distribution will require a mandatory 20% federal income tax to be deducted before the distribution is paid to you.  Prior to requesting a distribution from the Plan, please read the Federal Tax Information (see below) section of this SPD.  Death Benefit Distribution If you should die before your benefit is paid, your vested account balance will be paid to your spouse, domestic partner, or to your designated beneficiary(s).  Your surviving spouse, domestic partner, or beneficiary has the same distribution and/or payment options offered to a retiree.    If you officially retire from the Company and you subsequently die, your beneficiary will need to submit to the Employee Benefits Service Center a copy of your death certificate prior to the distribution of your vested account balance.  FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION  The Plan is intended to be qualified under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.  The related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions made by the Company on behalf of participants in the Plan are deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes.  Employer Contributions Company contributions on behalf of a participating employee are not includible in the employees gross income, and are not subject to federal income, Social Security or Medicare taxes at the time of contribution.  Plan Earnings Earnings or appreciation on Company contributions are not subject to federal income tax until such amounts are withdrawn by the employee or are distributed to the employee upon termination of employment, or are distributed to a beneficiary in the event of the employees death.  Distribution of Employer (Company) Contributions Distribution of employer contributions along with earnings and appreciation thereon will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Lump Sum Distributions Upon Total Disability or Termination of Employment The Plan provides that a distribution may be made in a lump-sum payment following an employees becoming totally disabled, or following an employees termination of employment  (including terminations of employment due to retirement or death). The amount of the lump-sum distribution, including earnings and appreciation on company contributions, is subject to federal income tax as ordinary income.  A lump-sum distribution may be subject to penalty and excise taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Rollover of Distributions A participant may defer federal income tax on all or any portion of a withdrawal (other     13 than hardship distributions) or a lump-sum distribution that is rolled over to another qualified plan or to an IRA.  A rollover can be made (1) by having the Trustee transfer all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution directly to another qualified plan or to the participants IRA, or (2) by having the Trustee distribute the full amount of a withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to the participant and the participant transfers all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to another qualified plan or to the participants IRA within 60 days after the participant receives the funds. If the Trustee transfers the funds to another qualified plan or the participants IRA, the funds transferred are not subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding. However, if the Trustee transfers the funds to the participant, the transferred funds are subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. A subsequent distribution from an IRA will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and will not qualify for special ten-year income averaging. Generally, the amount of the lump-sum distribution rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA will not be subject to excise or penalty taxes, but a subsequent distribution of a rolled over amount from another qualified plan or IRA may be subject to excise or penalty taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.   Penalty and Excise Taxes Unless certain exceptions apply, the taxable portion of any withdrawal, or the taxable portion of a lump-sum distribution that is not rolled over may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the distribution is made before the employee attains age 59 .  The federal tax information contained in this SPD briefly explains the federal tax aspects of participation in the Plan. The federal tax laws regarding participation in the Plan are extremely complex and no attempt has been made here to deal with the many special provisions that could be applicable to a particular situation or with the rules governing state, local or foreign taxes. Participants should consult their own counsel or other tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences to them or their beneficiaries.  SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO RESIDENTS  If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico law applies to your account as well as United States law.  In particular, there are special tax rules in Puerto Rico that affect your distribution. The following summary of the principal Puerto Rico income tax consequences of participation in the Plan, which apply to Participants who are residents of Puerto Rico, is based on the pertinent provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for a New Puerto Rico of 2011 (the Puerto Rico Code).  You should be aware that the Puerto Rico Code is subject to change and that such changes may be applied retroactively.  The Puerto Rico tax effects of participation in the Plan may vary depending on the facts and circumstances pertaining to each Participant.  You should consult your own tax advisor or financial planner concerning the Puerto Rico tax consequences to you of participation in the Plan when making any contribution, withdrawal, or distribution election under the Plan. You will not be taxed immediately on the Companys contributions to the Plan on your behalf or earnings that are credited to your account so long as the Plan remains tax-qualified.  You will be taxed on these amounts in the manner described below when they are actually distributed to you.      14 When you receive a distribution from your account, you will owe Puerto Rico income taxes on that amount except for the portion of a total distribution (as defined below) that is transferred to another employer plan qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code or to an individual retirement account or annuity under Section 1081.02 of the Puerto Rico Code.  The amount distributed, but not rolled over to another qualified plan or individual retirement account or annuity, including any investment earnings in your account, will be included in your gross income and taxed as ordinary income, subject to the exceptions set forth below.  All or a portion of a total distribution may be transferred to a nondeductible individual retirement account under Section 1081.03 of the Puerto Rico Code, but the transferred amount will be subject to tax, although the tax obligation will be considered to have been satisfied by the withholding of tax on the distribution if the remainder of the distribution is transferred to the nondeductible individual retirement account.  If your total account is distributed within a single taxable year due to your separation from service or plan termination (a total distribution), the amount of the total distribution is considered as long-term capital gain subject to a tax of 20%.  If your distribution is made after separation from service in the form of periodic payments, the distribution will be exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation in an amount up to $11,000 per year ($15,000 per year if you attain age 60 or over as of the last day of the year).  A total distribution generally is subject to withholding of 20% of the amount of the distribution.  Withholding tax does not apply to the portion of a total distribution that is transferred directly to an individual retirement account or annuity under the provisions of Section 1081.02 of the Puerto Rico Code, to a nondeductible individual retirement account under Section 1081.03 of the Puerto Rico Code, or to another employer plan qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code.  Partial distributions made after your separation from service are subject to 10% withholding.  However, if your distribution is in the form of an annuity or periodic payments by reason of a separation from service, including any required minimum distributions, withholding does not apply to the taxable amount of the distribution up to $26,500 for 2014 and $31,000 for 2015 and subsequent years ($30,500 for 2014 and $35,000 for 2015 and subsequent years if you attain age 60 or over by the end of the year).  Assuming the Plan remains qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code, the Company will generally be entitled to a Puerto Rico income tax deduction equal to the amount it contributes to the Plan.  CLAIM PROCEDURES    Claim for Benefits  If you believe that you are being denied rights or benefits under the Plan, you may file a claim in writing with the Plan Administrator at:     15   Administration Committee  c/o The Sherwin-Williams Company    Employee Benefits Department  101 Prospect Avenue NW, 1300 Midland   Cleveland, Ohio 44115  The Administration Committee will notify you of its decision in writing within 90 days after the claim is received (within 180 days if special circumstances require an extension  you will be notified of any extension within the initial 90-day period).  Initial Benefit Determination after a Claim is Filed The Administration Committee will have full discretion to deny or grant a claim in whole or part.  If your claim for benefits is wholly or partially denied, the Administration Committee will provide to you in writing:   specific reasons for the adverse determination;  specific reference to the pertinent provision of the Plan document on which the determination is based;  a description of any additional material or information necessary for you to perfect the claim and an explanation of why the material or information is necessary; and  a description of the plans review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimants right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.  If notice of the adverse benefit determination is not furnished in a timely manner, your claim will be deemed denied and you will be permitted to exercise your of review as described in the paragraph below.  Appeal of Your Initial Adverse Benefit Determination If your claim is denied, you may file a written request for review of the adverse determination within 60 days following receipt of an adverse determination.  The Administration Committee will appoint a special review committee to review your appeal.  If you do not request a review of the adverse determination within the 60-day timeframe, you may not challenge the adverse benefit determination.  In making any appeal of an adverse benefits determination, you have the right to:   submit a written request for review by the Administration Committee at:  Administration Committee  c/o The Sherwin-Williams Company    Employee Benefits Department  101 Prospect Avenue NW, 1300 Midland   Cleveland, Ohio 44115  review or have reasonable access to or copies of, upon request and free of charge, all Plan documents, records or other information relevant to the your claim for benefits; and  submit any written comments, documents, records or other information relevant to     16 the claim for benefits.    The Administration Committee will notify you of the special review committees determination no later than 60 days after receiving your request for review (within 120 days if an extension is required due to special circumstances  you will be notified of any extension within the initial 60-day period).  In the event of an adverse determination, you will be provided with a written explanation that will include the following information:   specific reasons for the adverse determination;  specific reference to the pertinent provisions of the Plan document on which the adverse determination is based;  a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimants claim for benefits; and  a statement of the claimants right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination on review.   If your claim is denied, you may bring legal action in court; provided, however, that you bring such action within one year of the mailing of the adverse benefit appeal determination. You must exhaust any and all administrative procedures set forth under the Plan before seeking relief in a court of law.  Except where ERISA applies, the Plan is construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  Military Leave If you return to employment following a military leave, you may be entitled to benefits under the Plan for the period that you were absent from employment.  You should see your Human Resource Representative for information regarding Plan benefits during military leave.   404(c) Compliance  The Plan is intended to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) Section 404(c).  Section 404(c) provides Plan fiduciaries with certain relief from liability for losses which are the direct and necessary result of participant investment instructions, provided that they have presented reasonable and adequate investment choices and information to participants.  Because you direct how contributions to your accounts are invested (including the use of certain qualified default investment funds such as life cycle pools about which you have received information), Plan fiduciaries who would otherwise be responsible under federal rules for directing investments are relieved of this responsibility with respect to those contributions.  As a result, those fiduciaries are not liable under the law for any loss to your accounts that are the direct and necessary result of your investment directions.  They are still responsible, however, for providing you with diverse investment opportunities and sufficient opportunity to direct the invest of your account.  You May Not Assign Your Account The Plan does not permit you or your beneficiary to assign, alienate, sell, transfer, or pledge the benefits under the Plan to a creditor or to anyone else, nor may any person create a lien on any funds, securities or other property held by the Plan.  These provisions     17 do not apply, however, in cases of certain qualified domestic relations court orders which create rights to Plan benefits for spouses, former spouses, children or other dependents of participants.  Administration of the Plan The Administration Committee is the Plan Administrator of the Plan.  The Administration Committee acts for the Company in administering the Plan.  The Administration Committee has the discretionary authority to interpret and apply the Plans provisions in its sole discretion.  The Administration Committee delegates the day-to-day Plan administration functions to the Employee Benefits Department.  The Plan text, trust agreement and the annual report are available for review by Plan participants or their beneficiaries at the Employee Benefits Department of The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio 44115 during normal working hours. Upon written request addressed to the Administration Committee, copies of these documents will be furnished, at a reasonable charge, to you as a Plan participant or your beneficiary. This SPD summarizes the main provisions of the Plan in non-technical language. It is not intended to give complete details, especially those details that apply to only a few employees. Full details of the Plan are contained in the legal Plan document.  In the event of any discrepancy between the Plan document and this SPD or in the event of an ambiguity in this SPD, the more detailed provisions of the Plan will govern.  Plan Expenses All reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to the fees of accountants, actuaries, counsel and other specialists and other costs of administration are paid from the Plans trust fund, unless the Company elects to make such payments.  The Plan Administrator has the discretion to direct payment of any administrative expenses attributable to a participants account to such account, including such costs incident to the management of the assets of an investment fund.  These expenses may include items such as domestic relations order review.  Note also that if you choose to leave your account in the Plan following termination from employment you may be assessed a small recordkeeping fee to reflect the cost the Company would otherwise pay for you as an active employee.  Missing Participants or Beneficiaries If you leave the employment of the Company, it is your responsibility to advise the Plan Trustee of any changes in your address.  Address changes for terminated employees can be made by contacting the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015. Neither the Administration Committee nor the Trustee shall be required to search for or locate a participant or beneficiary.  If you do not apply for benefits within 90 days of normal retirement date, your account may be forfeited.  It will be reinstated if you or your beneficiary request that your benefits be paid out.  Qualified Domestic Relations Order If, as a result of a divorce, you are responsible for child support, alimony or marital property rights payments, all or part of your Plan benefits may be assigned to meet these payments if a qualified domestic relations order, (which the Plan Administrator determines complies with the terms of the Plan) has been issued by a court.  Participants and beneficiaries can obtain, without a charge, copies of such procedures from the Plan     18 Administrator.  Top-Heavy Rules The top-heavy rules impose additional legal restrictions on tax qualified employee benefit plans where more than 60% of the benefits go to key employee (certain officers and highly paid employees).  If a plan is top-heavy, the special restrictions include provisions of certain minimum benefits and vesting. Unless the Plan is top-heavy, the rules have no effect. The Plan is not top-heavy at this time, and the Plan Administrator does not expect that it will become top-heavy.  Plan Continuation The Company reserves the right to suspend, reduce, or discontinue contributions.  It may also amend, modify or merge the Plan.  The Plan may be terminated by action of the Companys Board of Directors.  If the Plan terminates, Plan participants will become fully vested as of the date of such termination and will receive your distribution according to the terms of the Plan.   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  Benefits under this Plan are not guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) because the Plan is a defined contribution plan not subject to coverage by the PBGC, and Plan accounts are fully funded.   ERISA RIGHTS   Receive Information about Your Plan and Benefits In 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to safeguard the interests of participants and beneficiaries under employee benefit plans.  As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protection under ERISA.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:   examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrators office and at other specified locations, such as worksites, all documents governing the Plan and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration;  obtain copies, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, of all Plan documents governing the operation of the Plan, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated SPD. These copies shall be subject to a reasonable charge;  receive a summary of the Plans annual financial report.  The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report; and   receive annually a statement of your vested benefits or the earliest date on which benefits will become vested.  This statement must be requested in writing and is not required to be given more than once every 12 months.  The Plan must provide the state free of charge;        19 Prudent Action by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.  The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your employer, your union or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.  Enforce Your Rights If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial, you may obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and you have the right to have the Plan Administrator review and reconsider your claim, all within certain time schedules.    Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request, in writing, a copy of the Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive it within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court.  In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you with the requested materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive such materials, unless materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.  If you have a claim for benefits that are denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.   In addition, if you disagree with the Plans decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order, you may file suit in federal court.    If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plans money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.  Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.  ",

Usted no hace aportes a este Plan.  La Compaa Sherwin-Williams (\"Sherwin-Williams\" o la \"Compaa\") es responsable de financiar los beneficios obtenidos a travs de este Plan y, como tal, usted no est obligado a hacer contribuciones a este Plan.  Originalmente, este Plan se adopt el 1 de septiembre de 1947, y ha sido enmendado de vez en cuando a partir de esa fecha.  El 1 de enero de 1984, el Plan fue suspendido para los nuevos participantes.  En vigor a partir del 1 de enero de 2002 el Plan se enmend para incluir un nuevo plan de componentes hbridos basado en una frmula de edad y tiempo de servicio.  Subsecuentemente, la frmula del Plan con el componente hbrido de edad y tiempo de servicio se suspendi el 1 de octubre de 2011. El Encargado del registro del Plan es Fidelity Management Trust Company (\"Encargado del registro\").     Esta descripcin resumida del Plan recopila las principales caractersticas del Plan en vigor a partir del 1 de enero de 2015, para los empleados asalariados contratados por la Compaa en esa fecha que fueron contratados o recontratados por la Compaa despus del 1 enero de 2002 y antes del 1 de octubre de 2011 y que no estn cubiertos por el Plan enmendado de inversin de jubilacin para empleados asalariados de la Compaa o por el Plan anterior conocido como Apndice B, despus del 1 de enero de 2002.  Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta, que este resumen no pretende cubrir todos los detalles del Plan.  Se encuentra informacin ms detallada en el documento del Plan, que rige en el caso de cualquier discrepancia.  Una copia de ese documento legal est disponible para usted al ponerse en contacto con su Departamento de beneficios a empleados.  ASPECTOS DESTACADOS DEL PLAN  Los beneficios provistos por el Plan son totalmente financiados por la Compaa.  Si usted es elegible para participar, este Plan proporciona un beneficio cuando adquiere el derecho al saldo de su beneficio acumulado y se jubila o deja la Compaa por cualquier motivo.  El Plan tambin proporciona un beneficio a su cnyuge o beneficiario designado en caso que fallezca antes que se jubila o deja la compaa.  Tambin puede seleccionar una opcin de pago de beneficios que en algunos casos ofrece pagos continuos a su cnyuge o beneficiario despus de su fallecimiento si fallece despus de que inicien sus pagos.  Su Plan de inversin de jubilacin para empleados asalariados, junto con su participacin en el Plan de ahorro y compra de acciones para empleados de la Compaa, el Seguro Social y otros ahorros personales, puede ser una importante fuente de ingresos al momento de jubilarse.       4  Los beneficios del Plan descritos en esta Descripcin resumida del Plan incluyen:   Flexibilidad de distribucin de pensiones en la forma de un monto global, o diversas formas de anualidades vitalicias que incluyen disposiciones para que su cnyuge u otro beneficiario a reciban un beneficio, si usted fallece antes que su cnyuge o beneficiario designado,  Un beneficio pagadero a usted si usted deja la Compaa antes de la jubilacin, y adquiere el derecho a un beneficio bajo el Plan,  La posibilidad de seleccionar la asignacin de inversiones en las cuales se determina el saldo de su beneficio acumulado, en base a una variedad de mercado monetario, renta fija y fondos de capital de inversin, y  Acceso diario a su beneficio a travs del Internet o por telfono.  Con este acceso usted puede 1) obtener informacin sobre el saldo de su beneficio acumulado, 2) cambiar su asignacin de inversiones para los nuevos y existentes beneficios, y 3) solicitar una distribucin total del Plan una vez que cumpla con los requisitos para tal distribucin.

Para los participantes que finalizan el empleo y posteriormente son empleados nuevamente, se aplican reglas especiales (llamados \"Interrupcin de las reglas de continuidad en el servicio\" [Break in Service Rules]).  Comunquese con el Departamento de beneficios a empleados si tiene preguntas relacionadas con la participacin al ser recontratado.    CMO SE CALCULAN SUS BENEFICIOS  La Compaa financia a todos los beneficios de este Plan; usted no puede hacer contribuciones.  Usted es elegible para un beneficio cada ao si cumple con los requisitos de elegibilidad y participacin, segn se indic anteriormente.     Usted debe estar acreditado con 1,000 horas de servicio en un Ao del Plan para ser elegible para acumular un beneficio para ese Ao del Plan.

Comunquese con el Departamento de beneficios a empleados si tiene preguntas especficas acerca de estas circunstancias especiales.  Crditos de contribucin de la Compaa Si usted es un empleado y de otra manera es elegible para los crditos de contribucin, la Compaa acreditar crditos de contribucin a su cuenta en un monto basado en un porcentaje de sus ingresos \"acreditables\" (definidos ms adelante en esta seccin).  Este porcentaje de sus ingresos acreditables se determina en base a su edad y tiempo de servicio con la empresa, que se muestra en la siguiente tabla:  Si su combinacin de   Su Edad y aos de servicio  porcentaje del es entre:    crdito de contribucin es: 18 y 34.9    2.0% 35 y 44.9    2.5% 45 y 54.9    3.0% 55 y 64.9    3.5% 65 y 74.9    4.0% 75 y 84.9    5.0% 85 y 94.9    6.0% 95 y up     7.0%    6   Los ingresos acreditables generalmente incluyen todos sus ingresos tpicamente informados en su formulario W-2 anual con los siguientes ajustes:   el aumento de contribuciones antes de impuestos (tambin conocido como 401 (k)), si hubiere, al Plan de ahorro y compra de acciones para empleados o por cargos de atencin mdica antes de impuestos a su cheque de pago, y   disminuido por ayuda de matrcula, gastos de mudanza, ingresos de opciones, indemnizacin por despido y cualquier otro pago designado como no acreditable por la Compaa.  Tenga en cuenta que la ley federal impone un monto mximo de ganancias acreditables que se puede tomar en cuenta en el Plan en cualquier ao en particular.  Para 2015, ese monto es $265.000 (sujeto a ajustes anuales bajo las reglas del IRS).   Una vez que recibe sus Crditos de contribucin bajo el Plan, usted puede gestionar la manera en que los Crditos de contribucin se deben distribuir entre los fondos de inversin.  Si usted no proporciona esa gestin, los fondos se invertirn automticamente los efectos de determinar el saldo de su beneficio acumulado en el fondo \"por defecto\" del Plan.

Cada vez que llama y hace un cambio de inversin usted recibir una confirmacin por escrito del cambio.  SU CUENTA DE BENEFICIO ACUMULADO  El Fideicomisario del Plan mantiene todos los beneficios que usted acumula en el Plan y se acreditan a una cuenta administrativa en su nombre.  Sus Crditos de contribucin sern convertidos en unidades para determinar su beneficio acumulado, y representarn la mnima cantidad de su beneficio acumulado, sin tener en cuenta el rendimiento de sus fondos de inversin.  El Fiduciario acredita su cuenta de acuerdo con el Plan.  Usted puede indicarle al Fiduciario que asigne su beneficio en base a una o ms de las tasas de acreditacin disponibles bajo el Plan.    OPCIONES DE INVERSIN  El Plan ofrece una amplia gama de opciones de inversin que representan a todas las clases de activos primarios (inversiones a corto plazo, bonos y acciones).  Referirse a www.401k.com o llame al Encargado del registro al 1-800-323-4015 para solicitar una descripcin completa de la lista de fondos del Plan.  La lista de fondos puede cambiar de vez en cuando.  Las opciones de inversin ofrecidas por el Plan tienen diferentes objetivos de inversin, lo que le permite elegir qu opciones de inversin presentan el nivel de riesgo frente a la recompensa que usted estime apropiado para sus objetivos financieros.  Ms informacin sobre los objetivos de inversin de las distintas opciones de inversin, as como los honorarios y gastos asociados con cada opcin de inversin disponible, est disponible en www.401k.com o llamando al Encargado del registro en 1-800-323-4015    8  y solicitar folletos informativos gratuitos de los fondos.  Las diferentes opciones de inversin proporcionan una gama de oportunidades de riesgo, liquidez y rendimiento de la inversin.  Nadie, incluyendo la Compaa o el Encargado del registro, recomienda alguna inversin sobre otra.  Usted tendr que evaluar cules inversiones cumplen sus objetivos.  Su seleccin de opciones debe tener en cuenta su situacin financiera personal, incluyendo sus activos totales e inversiones dentro y fuera del Plan y el tiempo que planifica tener los fondos invertidos.  Fondos de jubilacin de fecha determinada El Plan ofrece opciones de inversin en fondos de jubilacin de fecha determinada, o (Target Date Funds, TDFs), para los empleados que no quieren gestionar activamente las tasas de acreditacin para sus cuentas de jubilacin.  Los TDF son los fondos \"por defecto\" del Plan.  Los TDF se reequilibran automticamente a ser ms conservadores a medida que un empleado se acerca a la jubilacin.  La \"fecha determinada\" se refiere a una fecha de jubilacin objetivo, y con frecuencia es parte del nombre del fondo.  Los TDF ofrecen una estrategia a largo plazo basada en una cartera con una mezcla de acciones, bonos y otras inversiones (esta mezcla se llama una asignacin de activos) que cambia automticamente a travs del tiempo a medida que envejece el participante.  La asignacin inicial de los activos de un TDF, cuando la fecha designada est a un nmero de aos en el futuro, por lo general consiste en su mayora de acciones o inversiones de capital, que a menudo tienen mayor potencial para rendimientos ms altos, pero tambin pueden ser ms voltiles y conllevar un mayor riesgo de inversin.  A medida que se acerca la fecha determinada de jubilacin, se cambia la asignacin de activos del fondo para incluir una mayor proporcin de inversiones ms conservadoras, como bonos e instrumentos de efectivo, que en general son menos voltiles y llevan menos riesgo de la inversin que las acciones.  Es posible que este fondo \"por defecto\" no proporcione el nivel ms adecuado de riesgo frente a la recompensa para sus circunstancias particulares, por lo que la evaluacin y seleccin de sus inversiones es extremadamente importante.  Siempre podr cambiar su gestin de inversin, incluyendo el intercambio de fondos previamente contribuidos, en cualquier da hbil, conectndose a www.401k.com o llamando al Encargado del registro al 1-800-323-4015.  ADQUISICIN DE DERECHOS  La adquisicin de derechos le proporciona \"titularidad\" de su beneficio del Plan, lo que significa que usted es elegible para recibir el saldo de su beneficio segn sus derechos adquiridos cuando abandona la Compaa.  Usted acumula derechos sobre su beneficio del Plan basado en la acumulacin de 1,000 horas de servicio de adquisicin de derechos con la empresa cada ao del Plan.  Los requisitos de adquisicin de derechos del Plan para los empleados activos cambiaron el 1 de enero de 2007.  La adquisicin de derechos sobre las contribuciones de la Compaa anteriores al 1 de enero de 2007 requiere cinco (5) aos de servicio de adquisicin de derechos.  A partir del 1 de enero 2007, si usted es empleado    9  activamente por la Compaa, usted obtiene el 100% de derechos adquiridos sobre el beneficio de la Compaa una vez que acumula tres (3) aos de servicio de adquisicin de derechos en el Plan.  No existe la adquisicin parcial de derechos; si abandona la Compaa antes de tener tres aos de derechos adquiridos en el Plan (cinco aos si se va antes del 1 de enero de 2007), usted pierde todos sus derechos a su beneficio.   Prdida de derechos La porcin de su beneficio de la Compaa sobre cual no adquiri derechos se perder despus de abandonar la Compaa. Si abandona la Compaa, y ms tarde vuelve a ser empleado por la Compaa, usted puede tener derecho a un reintegro de la porcin perdida de su cuenta de beneficio acumulado, dependiendo de varios factores como se indica en el documento del Plan.  Comunquese con el Departamento de Beneficios a empleados si tiene preguntas relacionadas con la participacin al ser recontratado, y si algunas prdidas de derechos son elegibles para la rehabilitacin.

You make no contributions to this Plan.  The Sherwin-Williams Company (Sherwin-Williams or the Company) is responsible for funding the benefits earned under this Plan and, as such, you are not required to make contributions to this Plan.  This Plan was originally adopted on September 1, 1947, and has been amended from time to time thereafter.  On January 1, 1984 the Plan was frozen to new Participants.  Effective January 1, 2002, the Plan was amended to include a new hybrid component plan based on an age and service Formula.  The hybrid age and service formula component of the Plan was subsequently frozen on October 1, 2011. The Recordkeeper for the Plan is Fidelity Management Trust Company (Recordkeeper).     This Summary Plan Description summarizes the main features of the Plan effective January 1, 2015, for salaried employees employed by the Company on that date who were hired or rehired by the Company on or after January 1, 2002 and prior to October 1, 2011, and who are not covered by either the Companys Salaried Employees Revised Pension Investment Plan or the prior Plan formula known as Appendix B after January 1, 2002.  Keep in mind, however, that this summary does not attempt to cover all of the details of the Plan.  More detailed information is contained in the Plan document, which governs in the event of any discrepancies.  A copy of that legal document is available to you by contacting your Employee Benefits Department.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PLAN  Benefits provided under the Plan are entirely funded by the Company.  If you are eligible to participate, this Plan provides a benefit when you become vested in your accrued benefit balance and retire or leave the Company for any reason.  The Plan also provides a benefit to your spouse or named beneficiary should you die before you retire or leave the Company.  You may also select a benefit payment option that in some cases provides continuing payments to your spouse or beneficiary following your death if you die after your payments begin.  Your Salaried Employees Pension Investment Plan, along with your participation in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan, Social Security, and any other personal savings, can be an important source of income at retirement.  Plan benefits described in this Summary Plan Description include:   Pension distribution flexibility in the form of a lump sum amount, or various forms of life annuities that include provisions for your spouse or other beneficiary to receive a benefit, if you die before your spouse or named beneficiary,    4   A benefit payable to you if you leave the Company before retirement, and are vested in a benefit under the Plan,  The ability to select the allocation of investments on which your accrued benefit balance is determined, based on a variety of money market, fixed income and equity funds, and  Daily access to your benefit via the Internet or by telephone.  With this access you can 1) get information on your accrued benefit balance, 2) change your investment allocation for new and existing benefits, and 3) request a total distribution from the Plan once you are eligible for such a distribution.  ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION  As an employee of the Company, to become eligible to accrue Plan benefits, you must:   be an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company which has adopted the Plan,  not be a member of a collective bargaining unit unless eligibility for the Plan is extended to such members through negotiation,  not be accruing a benefit under another defined benefit plan of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company,  be a citizen of the United States if you are working abroad, under certain circumstances described in the Plan, or if a non-US citizen, working in the United States, and  be hired or re-hired on or after January 1, 2002 and prior to October 1, 2011, or a Participant under the prior Plan for periods after January 1, 2002.  You begin participation in the Plan once certain conditions are met:  You must complete 6 months of service with the Company (this makes you eligible to participate in the Plan), and you must also complete at least 1,000 hours of service during the calendar year as a Company employee (this gives you participation, vesting service, and accrued benefit service associated with your benefit).  Once you meet the eligibility and participation requirements, membership in the Plan is automatic and the Company will mail you a participation package.  This package provides you with additional information on the Plan and how to select investment allocations for your accrued benefit balance funded by the Company.  For participants who terminate employment and are later re-employed, special rules (called Break in Service Rules) apply.  Contact the Employee Benefits Department if you have questions relating to participation upon re-employment.       5  CALCULATING YOUR BENEFITS  The Company funds all benefits in this Plan - you cannot make contributions.  You are eligible for a benefit each year if you meet the eligibility and participation requirements, as previously discussed.    You must be credited with 1,000 hours of service in a Plan Year to be eligible to accrue a benefit for that Plan Year.  You may also be eligible for a benefit during the year in which you a) are eligible to retire, b) die, or c) ceased to meet the eligibility requirements without terminating employment (i.e., change from salaried to a collective bargaining unit or are on an approved leave-of-absence).  Contact the Employee Benefits Department if you have specific questions about these special circumstances.  Company Contribution Credits If you are an employee and are otherwise eligible for the Contribution Credits, the Company will credit Contribution Credits to your account in an amount based on a percentage of your creditable earnings (defined later in this section).  This percentage of your creditable earnings is determined by your age and service with the Company, shown in the following table:  If your combination of    Your Age and Service years   Contribution Credit is between:     Percentage is: 18 and 34.9    2.0% 35 and 44.9    2.5% 45 and 54.9    3.0% 55 and 64.9    3.5% 65 and 74.9    4.0% 75 and 84.9    5.0% 85 and 94.9    6.0% 95 and up     7.0%  Creditable earnings generally includes all of your earnings typically reported on your annual W-2 form with the following adjustments:   increased for pre-tax (also known as 401(k)) contributions you make, if any, to the Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan or for pre-tax health care charges to your paycheck, and   decreased by tuition aid, moving expenses, option income, separation pay and any other pay designated as non-creditable by the Company.  Note that federal law imposes a maximum amount of creditable earnings which may be taken into account under the Plan for any particular year.  For 2015, that amount is $265,000 (subject to adjustment annually under IRS rules).     6   Once you receive your Contribution Credits under the Plan, you may designate the manner in which the Contribution Credits are to be directed among the investment funds.  If you do not provide such direction, the funds will be automatically invested for purposes of determining your accrued benefit balance in the Plans default fund.  The Plans default fund will consist of a target date retirement fund that closely matches your retirement date based on a projected retirement age of 65.  For more information please see the Target Date Retirement Funds discussion under INVESTMENT OPTIONS.    DIRECTING YOUR BENEFIT INVESTMENTS  You dont need to fill out a form to direct how your benefit is invested in the Plan.  To make this direction, you simply log on to the Companys retirement plan website at www.401k.com.  You can direct your investment accounts virtually 24 hours a day through the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  A Voice Response System is available virtually 24 hours a day, or you can speak directly to a service representative any business day between the hours of 8:30 AM and 12:00 Midnight.  When you first direct the investments used to determine your accrued benefit balance, you will:   establish a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be used to access your benefit in the future, and  choose how you want your Company-funded benefit to be invested.  The value of your accrued benefit balance will be determined based on how you direct your investment accounts in the Plan.  CHANGING YOUR BENEFIT INVESTMENTS  You can change your investment account direction any business day by logging on to the Companys Retirement Plan website at www.401k.com, or by calling the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  Transfers can be in whole percentages, or you can request specific dollar amounts to be transferred from one investment account to another.    If you request a transfer (exchange) of one or more investment accounts after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time or on weekends or holidays you will receive the next business days closing price. Requests received prior to 4:00 p.m. will receive that business days closing price. Also, while the transfer in and out of available investment accounts is seldom interrupted, the available investment accounts may modify or suspend the transfer (exchange) provision for a period of time.   Each time you call and make an investment change you will receive a written confirmation of the change.     7  YOUR ACCRUED BENEFIT ACCOUNT  All the benefits you accrue in the Plan are held by the Plan Trustee and credited to an administrative account in your name.  Your Contribution Credits will be converted into units to determine your accrued benefit, and will represent the minimum amount of your accrued benefit, without taking into account your investment funds performance.  The Trustee credits your account in accordance with the Plan.  You may instruct the Trustee to allocate your benefit based on one or more of the crediting rates available under the Plan.    INVESTMENT OPTIONS  The Plan offers a broad range of investment options representing all the primary asset classes (short-term investments, bonds and stocks).  Refer to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to request a full description of the Plans fund line-up.  The list of funds can change from time-to-time.  The investment options offered by the Plan have different investment objectives, allowing you to choose which investment options present the level of risk versus reward you feel is appropriate for your financial goals.  More information regarding the investment objectives of the various investment options, as well as the fees and expenses associated with each available investment option, is available at www.401k.com or by calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and requesting free fund prospectuses.  The different investment options provide a range of risk, liquidity, and investment return opportunities.  No one, including the Company or the Recordkeeper, recommends any investment over the other.  You will need to assess what investments meet your objectives.  Your selection of options should take into account your personal financial situation, including your total assets and investments both inside and outside the Plan and how long you intend to have the funds invested.  Target Date Retirement Funds The Plan offers target date retirement investment fund options, or TDFs, for employees who do not want to actively manage crediting rates for their retirement accounts.  The TDFs are the Plans default fund.  The TDFs automatically rebalance to become more conservative as an employee gets closer to retirement.  The target date refers to a target retirement date, and often is part of the name of the fund.  The TDFs offer a long-term strategy based on holding a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments (this mix is called an asset allocation) that automatically changes over time as the participant ages.  A TDFs initial asset allocation, when the target date is a number of years away, usually consists mostly of stocks or equity investments, which often have greater potential for higher returns but also can be more volatile and carry greater investment risk.  As the target retirement date    8  approaches, the funds asset allocation shift to include a higher proportion of more conservative investments, like bonds and cash instruments, which generally are less volatile and carry less investment risk than stocks.  This default fund may not provide the most appropriate level of risk versus reward for your particular circumstances, so evaluating and selecting your investments is extremely important.  You can always change your investment direction, including exchanging previously contributed funds, on any business day by logging on to www.401k.com or calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  VESTING  Vesting gives you ownership of you Plan benefit, which means that you are eligible to receive your vested accrued benefit when you leave the Company.  You accrue vesting on your Plan benefit based on accumulating 1,000 hours of vesting service with the Company each Plan year.  Plan vesting requirements for active employees changed on January 1, 2007.  Vesting in the Company contributions prior to January 1, 2007 requires five (5) years of vesting service.  Beginning January 1, 2007 if you are actively employed by the Company, you become 100% vested in the Company benefit once you earn three (3) vesting years in the Plan.  There is no partial vesting; if you leave the Company before earning three vesting years in the Plan (five years if you leave prior to January 1, 2007), you forfeit your entire benefit.   Forfeitures The non-vested portion of your Company benefit will be forfeited after you leave the Company. If you leave the Company, then later become re-employed by the Company, you may be entitled to a reinstatement of the forfeited portion of your accrued benefit account, depending on several factors as outlined in the Plan document.  Contact the Employee Benefits Department if you have questions relating to re-employment participation, and whether any previous forfeitures are eligible for reinstatement.  HOW YOUR BENEFIT IS VALUED  Your accrued benefit account is determined at the end of every business day. You can log on to the Companys retirement plan website at www.401k.com, or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 virtually any time - day or night - to obtain the current lump sum value of your accrued benefit balance.     9  Benefit Statements At the end of each quarter, you will receive a statement showing the value of your accrued benefit account at the beginning of the quarter, the activity in your account for the quarter and an ending benefit value for the quarter. Your statement will be sent to you approximately twenty days after the close of the quarter.  CHANGES TO YOUR EMPLOYMENT STATUS  Your level of participation in the Plan will depend on your employment status.  If You Retire If you retire from the Company, you will elect a benefit option offered by the Plan.  Refer to the Retirement Distributions section of this summary document for further details.   If You Terminate Employment If you leave the Company for any reason other than retirement, the value of your vested account will automatically be distributed in accordance with the law if the total value is $5,000 or less. For more information, refer to the Automatic Distributions and Rollovers section of this summary plan description.  Vested account balances above $5,000 will remain in the Plan and will require your consent before your benefit can be paid.  If you do not call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and request a distribution of your vested accrued benefit balance, you will continue to be a Plan participant subject to the following:  You will be eligible to change investment accounts,  You can request a full distribution of your accrued benefit balance any time,  You will be required to take a minimum distribution each year once you attain age 70 , and  Your accrued benefit balance will be paid to your named beneficiary should you die before taking a full distribution.  If You Are on a Leave of Absence While you are on leave of absence you cannot request a distribution of your vested accrued benefit balance.  However, while you are on a leave of absence you can continue to direct Company contributions and transfer funds among the Plans investments.  If You Are Totally Disabled If you are considered totally disabled and you are collecting Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits, you will remain a participant in the Plan. Totally disabled means you are unable to work at any gainful occupation for which you may be able to perform, or may reasonably become qualified to perform by education, training or experience. If you are considered totally disabled and continue to collect long term disability benefits from the Company, or you are still on an approved leave of absence, you will not be eligible for a distribution from the Plan of your accrued benefit balance without stopping all other benefits.     10  While on leave of absence or LTD you will continue to be a Plan participant subject to the following:  You will be eligible to change investment accounts.  Your accrued benefit balance will be paid to your named beneficiary should you die before taking a full distribution.  If You Die Please refer to the section titled, Death Benefit Distribution of this Summary Plan Description for payment of death benefits.  WHEN YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS/DISTRIBUTIONS    You can begin collecting benefits from the Plan after you terminate from employment with a vested benefit (including retirement after age 65  Normal Retirement under the Plan), become disabled or die.        Retirement Distributions    You are eligible to retire from the Company if:  you are 55 through 59 years old, and you have at least 20 years of Service,  you are 60 years old or older, and the sum of your age and years of Service equal at least 75, or  you are 65 years old (Normal Retirement).  To apply for retirement benefits (if you are eligible), contact the Employee Benefits Service Center at 1-800-792-1110 approximately 90 days prior to your anticipated retirement date to request a retirement package.  The retirement package will include an Application For Retirement form which describes the distribution options that are available.  These options are: 1. One Payment (Lump Sum) 2. Variable Annuity (Joint & Survivor or Single Life Annuity)   1. One Payment  If you elect the One Payment option, you have two choices of distribution:  You can elect a direct rollover of your accrued benefit balance to another employer retirement plan (or an individual retirement account -- IRA), or  You can elect to have your accrued benefit balance paid directly to you.    2. Variable Annuity  Under the variable annuity option, you can select a Joint & Survivor or Single Life Annuity option.   The variable annuity option will vary regarding the payment amount each year.  The variable annuity will be recalculated and re-established each year by the Plan Administrator.  The annuity amount will increase or decrease as a result of several factors including prior-year returns, mortality, and prevailing interest rates.      11    If you elect the Joint & Survivor Annuity option, estimates will be provided to you as to the amount you (and your spouse) can expect to receive on a monthly basis from the annuity for your lifetimes.  The Joint & Survivor Annuity will be based on your accrued benefit balance at the time you retire, and may provide for survivor annuity payments to continue to your surviving spouse after your death in the amount of either 50% or 75% of the amount payable to you prior to your death (the annuity amount being subject to annual recalculation as described above). Note that you may select a joint annuitant who is not your spouse for purposes of the 50% option, but only if you are not married when benefit payments start or your spouse has otherwise consented to another beneficiary.  If you wish to waive the Joint & Survivor Annuity option and choose one of the other Retirement options available (and you are married at the time you retire), your spouse must consent to this waiver by signing the Spousal Consent on the Application For Retirement form.  Your spouses signature must be witnessed by a Plan Representative or Notary Public.    If you elect the Single Life Annuity option, you will receive estimates of the amount that will be paid to you monthly for your lifetime.  If you are married at the time of retirement and elect the Single Life Annuity option, the Spousal Consent on the Application For Retirement form must be completed and your spouses signature must be witnessed by a Plan Representative or Notary Public.    Changing your Elections  Before Retirement Once you have elected a post retirement option, you are still free to change your mind and either select another post retirement option, or completely cancel the option.  Remember however, your Spouses written consent is always required to elect an option other than either the post retirement 50% or 75% Joint & Survivor Variable Annuity.  After Retirement You MAY NOT change or cancel the type of option you selected once any form of benefit payment has been made or started.  Termination of Employment If you terminated your employment from The Sherwin-Williams Company for any reason (other than retirement or death) and you are not on a leave of absence, and you are 100% vested in your Plan benefit, you may call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to request a full distribution of your accrued benefit balance from the Plan.  The payment options described above for retirement are also available to you.  To receive a full distribution in a single payment will require you to waive the Single Life Annuity, if you are not married, or the Joint and Survivor Annuity Option of distribution, if you are married, and your spouse will need to consent to this lump    12  sum distribution by signing a distribution form and having his/her signature notarized.  When electing a lump sum distribution, you have two choices of distribution: 1. You can elect a direct rollover of a cash distribution to another employer retirement plan or an IRA arrangement.  There will be no taxes deducted for this direct rollover, or 2. You can have the distribution paid directly to you.  This type of distribution will require a mandatory 20% federal income tax to be deducted before the distribution is paid to you.  Prior to requesting a distribution from the Plan, please read the Federal Tax Information section of this Summary Plan Description.  Death Benefit Distribution If you should die before retirement while employed by the Company, your accrued benefit balance will become fully vested and paid to your spouse (if you are married), or to your designated beneficiary(s).  Your surviving spouse or named beneficiary(s) has the same distribution and/or payment options offered to a retiree.  If you officially retire from the Company and later die, it will depend on the retirement option you elected as to whether there is any benefit to be paid to a beneficiary.   For example, if you elected to receive the One Payment option, your full benefit will have already been paid out.  However, if you selected one of the Variable Annuity options, there may be a remaining balance that will be paid to your joint annuitant.    Your spouse or beneficiary will need to submit to Employee Benefits an original death certificate and other necessary paperwork prior to the distribution of your accrued benefit balance.  Automatic Distributions and Rollover If you terminate employment with the Company and your vested account balance is $5,000 or less, such balance will be automatically distributed in accordance with the law.  In the event the balance is $1,000 or less, the distribution will be made to you directly, unless you provide instructions regarding a direct rollover to an IRA or other eligible retirement plan.  In the event the balance is at least $1,000 and not more than $5,000, you may request that payment be made to you directly (subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding) or you may provide instructions for rollover to an IRA or eligible retirement plan which accepts rollovers, as you choose.  In the event no such directions are provided by you, an IRA will be established for you and your benefit will be automatically rolled over to that IRA.  If you terminate employment with the Company and your vested benefit is greater than $5,000, you may leave your balance in the Plan until a later time. Notwithstanding the above, the Plan and the Internal Revenue Code provide that a    13  distribution of your benefit must commence no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you attain age 70 .    YOUR BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION  It is essential that you establish one or more beneficiaries to receive your account balance in the Plan in case of your death.  Log on to www.401k.com, click on the Your Profile tab, and then click Beneficiaries.  Follow the step-by-step instructions to designate your beneficiary.  If you do not have internet access, you can call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a beneficiary form.    If you do not designate your beneficiary your vested retirement benefits will be distributed to your eligible spouse or, if single, to your estate.  If you are married, the Plan will automatically purchase a survivor annuity with your vested account balance that will be immediately payable to your spouse on a monthly basis (the default benefit payment).  However, for benefit payments that have not started as of January 1, 2010, in the event of your death before commencement your eligible spouse may elect an optional form of benefit in lieu of any election form on file.  Similarly, if you are not married your beneficiary may elect an optional form of benefit as permitted by the Plan.  Please remember, as events in your life change over time you can always update your beneficiary elections by logging on to www.401k.com or calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a new form.  SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND DOMESTIC PARTNERS  If you have a Domestic Partner to whom you are not married, under the Plan you will be treated as married, and your Domestic Partner will be treated as a spouse (other than for purposes of applying the automatic annuity provision described above).  If you do not name a beneficiary and you have a Domestic Partner, your Domestic Partner will be your beneficiary.  For purposes of the Plan, a Domestic Partner means (1) a person (of the same-sex or opposite-sex) with whom you have a current valid domestic partnership registration, civil union certificate, or similar document from any state or local government agency authorized to perform such registration or civil union, or (2) if no valid partnership registration, civil union certificate, or similar document exists from any state, a person (of the same-sex or opposite-sex) in a relationship with you where you have:   Have lived together for at least one year,  Are both age 18 years or older and mentally competent to enter into a legal contract,  Are both in an exclusive relationship,  Are both not married to anyone else,  Are both not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the state,    14   Share the same regular and permanent residence with the current intent of doing so indefinitely,  Are financially interdependent on each other which financial interdependence may be subject to documentation in accordance with procedures established by the Administration Committee, to the extent consistent with pertinent law, and  Were mentally competent to enter into the relationship at the time when the domestic partnership began.  Please note that for purposes of Plan rollover rules, under federal tax law your Domestic Partner is not treated as a spouse.  Similarly, your Domestic Partner is not treated as a spouse for purposes of tax rules relating to required minimum distributions following your death.  Please note that effective June 26, 2013, if you are married to a person of the same sex in a marriage validly entered into in a state whose laws authorize the marriage of two persons of the same sex, you are married for all Plan and tax purposes, and the Domestic Partner provisions described above do not apply.  WHEN YOU WILL PAY TAXES  Tax on Distributions Your pension is fully taxable as ordinary income when you receive it.  If you receive a pension distribution before age 59, your payout may be subject to an additional 10% penalty tax as well as ordinary income taxes.  However, the penalty tax may not apply if your pension is distributed because of    retirement at age 55 or later,  death, or  a qualified domestic relations order.  If you elect a lump sum distribution of your accrued benefit balance, government regulations require that 20% of your distribution be withheld automatically, unless you directly roll over the amount to an IRA or another employer retirement plan.  The withheld amount will be applied toward your income taxes for the year in which you receive the distribution.  You must provide your written election to the Pension Administration Committee to direct your distribution to be rolled over directly into an IRA (or another employer retirement plan that accepts rollovers) to avoid the 20% withholding.  You will not pay taxes until you take the money out of the IRA or other employer retirement plan, at which time you will pay ordinary income tax (and, if applicable, the additional 10% penalty tax for premature distributions) on the money you receive.  It should be noted that a rollover may also be made to a Roth IRA, which would mean that you pay ordinary income tax at the time of the rollover but may not owe additional income tax on future earnings.      15  When You Need Tax Advice Because tax laws are complex and subject to change, this information is intended only as a general guideline based on our understanding of the federal income tax law in effect when this Summary Plan Description was published.  For your own protection, you should consult a tax specialist before you receive any Plan money that is subject to tax.  FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION  The Plan is intended to be qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), as amended.  The related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. Contributions made by the Company on behalf of participants in the Plan are deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes.  Employer Contributions: Company contributions on behalf of a participating employee are not includible in the employees gross income, and are not subject to federal income, Social Security or Medicare taxes at the time of contribution.  Plan Earnings: Earnings or appreciation on Company contributions are not subject to federal income tax until such amounts are withdrawn by the employee or are distributed to the employee upon termination of employment, or are distributed to a beneficiary in the event of the employees death.  Distribution of Employer (Company) Contributions: Distribution of employer contributions along with earnings and appreciation thereon will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Lump Sum Distributions upon Termination of Employment, including Retirement, Total Disability, and Death: The Plan provides that a distribution due to retirement, death, total disability, or other termination of employment may be made in a lump-sum distribution. The amount of the lump-sum distribution equal to the sum of after-tax contributions not previously withdrawn is not subject to federal income tax. The amount of the lump-sum distribution, including earnings and appreciation on company and employee contributions, is subject to federal income tax as ordinary income.  However, a qualifying lump-sum distribution may be eligible for special ten-year income averaging (if you were born prior to January 1, 1936) for federal income tax purposes.  A lump-sum distribution may be subject to penalty and excise taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Rollover of Distributions: A participant may defer federal income tax on all or any portion of a withdrawal (other than hardship distributions) or a lump-sum distribution that is rolled over to another employer retirement plan or to an IRA. A rollover can be made (1) by having the Plan trustee transfer all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution directly to another employer retirement plan or    16  to the participants IRA, or (2) by having the Trustee distribute the full amount of a withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to the participant and the participant transfers all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to another employer retirement plan or to the participants IRA within 60 days after the participant receives the funds. If the Trustee transfers the funds to another employer retirement plan or the participants IRA, the funds transferred are not subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding. However, if the Trustee transfers the funds to the participant, the transferred funds are subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. A subsequent distribution from an IRA will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and will not qualify for special ten-year income averaging. Generally, the amount of the lump-sum distribution rolled over to another employer retirement plan or IRA will not be subject to excise or penalty taxes, but a subsequent distribution of a rolled over amount from another employer retirement plan or IRA may be subject to excise or penalty taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Note, also, that if a rollover is made to the participants Roth IRA, income tax will be due at the time of the rollover.  Penalty and Excise Taxes: Unless certain exceptions apply, the taxable portion of any withdrawal, or the taxable portion of a lump-sum distribution that is not rolled over may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the distribution is made before the participant attains age 59 .  The federal tax information contained in this Summary Plan Description briefly explains the federal tax aspects of participation in the Plan. The federal tax laws regarding participation in the Plan are extremely complex and no attempt has been made here to deal with the many special provisions that could be applicable to a particular situation or with the rules governing state, local or foreign taxes. Participants should consult their own counsel or other tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences to them or their beneficiaries.  Puerto Rico Only:  The Plan is intended to be qualified under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended (PRIRC).  The income tax rules for participants who reside in Puerto Rico are different in some ways from those described above.  As noted above, tax information provided here is only a general guideline based on our understanding of the PRIRC as presently in effect, and you should consult a tax specialist before you receive any Plan money that is subject to tax.  For benefits payable in Puerto Rico, you should note the following:   Lump sum payments are considered long-term capital gain and are generally subject to the payment of Puerto Rico income taxes at a 20% rate; mandatory 20% income tax withholding applies.  (Special rules for lower rates if Plan investments are based in Puerto Rico do not apply to this Plan.)  Rollovers of whole or partial distributions to another retirement plan or individual retirement account are permitted.    17   Annuity payments are taxed as ordinary income, although each year the first $11,000 ($15,000, if age 60 or over) is excluded from gross income.  Mandatory 10% withholding applies to annual amounts in excess of the first $19,500 ($23,500, if age 60 or over).  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  Military Leave If you return to employment following a military leave, you may be entitled to benefits under the Plan for the period that you were absent from employment.  You should see your Human Resource Representative for information regarding Plan benefits during military leave.  You May Not Assign or Alienate Your Account The Plan does not permit you or your beneficiary to assign, alienate, sell, transfer, or pledge the benefits under the Plan to a creditor or to anyone else, nor may any person create a lien on any funds, securities or other property held by the Plan.  These provisions do not apply, however, in cases of certain qualified domestic relations court orders that create rights to Plan benefits for spouses, former spouses, children or other dependents of participants.  Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or QDRO If, as a result of a divorce, you are responsible for child support, alimony or marital property rights payments, all or part of your pension plan benefits may be assigned to meet these payments if a qualified domestic relations order, which the Plan Administrator determines complies with the terms of the Plan, has been issued by a court.  Administrator of the Plan The Plan text, trust agreement and the annual report are available for review by Plan participants or their beneficiaries at the Employee Benefits office of The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio  44115 during normal working hours. Upon written request addressed to the Administration Committee, copies of these documents will be furnished, at a reasonable charge, to you as a Plan participant or your beneficiary. This Summary Plan Description summarizes the main provisions of the Plan in non-technical language. It is not intended to give complete details, especially those details that apply to very few employees. Full details of the Plan are contained in the legal Plan document.  Plan Expenses All administrative expenses and fees incident to the operation and management of the Plan and the Trust Fund, and other costs of purchases and sales under the various investment funds which are charged to such funds, shall be paid by the Plan, unless the Company elects to make payment.      18  Missing Participants or Beneficiaries If you leave the employment of the Company, it is your responsibility to advise the Plan Trustee of any changes in your address.  Address changes for terminated employees can be made by contacting the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015. Neither the Administration Committee nor the Trustee shall be required to search for or locate a Participant or beneficiary.  If you do not apply for benefits within 90 days of normal retirement date, your Account may be forfeited.  It will be reinstated if you or your beneficiary request that your benefits be paid out.  Top-Heavy Rules  This Plan contains rules that would take effect automatically for any year in the unlikely event that the Plan becomes top-heavy. A top-heavy plan is one in which the total account for certain key (highly-paid) employees exceed 60% of the total accounts for all employees under the Plan. The top-heavy rules provide for, among other things, accelerated vesting of accounts and minimum contribution levels for participants.  The Plan Administrator will advise you of your rights under the top-heavy rules if the Plan becomes top-heavy.  The Future of the Plan While the Company expects to continue the Plan indefinitely, it reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time by action of its board of directors.  In no event will an amendment have the effect of reducing your benefit.  In the case of Plan termination, you would become fully vested in the benefits you had earned through the date the Plan is terminated.  Plan assets would be distributed to participants or continued in trust for the participants benefit.  Any residual assets would revert to the Company.  If the assets are not sufficient to provide all Plan benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) takes over, as explained next.  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Your pension benefits under this Plan are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a federal insurance agency.  If the Plan terminates (ends) without enough money to pay all benefits, the PBGC will step in to pay pension benefits. Most people receive all of the pension benefits they would have received under their plan, but some people may lose certain benefits.  The PBGC guarantee generally covers:   normal and early retirement benefits,  disability benefits if you become disabled before the plan terminates, and   certain benefits for your survivors.  The PBGC guarantee generally does not cover:     19   benefits greater than the maximum guaranteed amount set by law for the year in which the plan terminates,  some or all of benefit increases and new benefits based on plan provisions that have been in place for fewer than 5 years at the time the plan terminates,  benefits that are not vested because you have not worked long enough for the company,  benefits for which you have not met all of the requirements at the time the plan terminates,  certain early retirement payments (such as supplemental benefits that stop when you become eligible for Social Security) that result in an early retirement monthly benefit greater than your monthly benefit at the Plans normal retirement age, and  non-pension benefits, such as health insurance, life insurance, certain death benefits, vacation pay and severance pay.  Even if certain of your benefits are not guaranteed, you still may receive some of those benefits from the PBGC depending on how much money your Plan has and on how much the PBGC collects from employers.  For more information about the PBGC and the benefits it guarantees, ask your Plan Administrator or contact:  Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.  Technical Assistance Branch 1200 K Street N.W., Suite 930 Washington, D.C.  20005-4026 or call 202-326-4040(not a toll-free number). TTY/TDD users may call the federal relay service toll-free at 1-800-877-8339 and ask to be connected to 202-326-4000.  Additional information about the PBGCs pension insurance program is available through the PBGCs website on the Internet at http://www.pbgc.gov  Claims Review Procedure If your claim for benefits is denied (including any case where you do not think your benefits are properly determined), you may ask the Administration Committee to reconsider the matter within 60 days after receiving a notice of denial. If the Administration Committee does not feel that the circumstances warrant any different action from that taken, you will be furnished with a written notice explaining:  Specific reasons for the decision,  Specific reference to the pertinent provision of the Plan document on which the decision is based,  Any additional information or facts necessary to complete your claim and an explanation of why such additional information is necessary, and  Your right to appeal the decision.    20   You will usually be notified within 120 days of your request. If special circumstances require an extension of time, you will be notified before the expiration of the 120-day period of the special circumstances and the date (not later than an additional 120 days) by which you will receive a decision.  Within 60 days after you receive a written notification of the decision from the Administration Committee, you or your duly authorized representative may:  File a written appeal to The Sherwin-Williams Company Administration Committee, The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio 44115, for a full and fair review,  Review pertinent documents, and  Submit issues and comments in writing. A written decision will usually be made by the Administration Committee within 60 days after it receives your request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing) require an extension of time for not more than an additional 60 days. The decision on review will include the specific reasons for the  decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.  Any law suit brought with respect to a decision on appeal must be brought within one year of the mailing of the Administration Committees written decision.  ERISA Rights As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:  Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrators office and at other principal offices of the Company, all documents governing the Plan and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration,  Obtain copies, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, of all Plan documents governing the operation of the Plan, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated Summary Plan Description. These copies shall be subject to a reasonable charge,  Receive a summary of the Plans annual funding notice. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual notice,  Receive annually upon written request a statement of your vested benefits or the earliest date on which benefits will become vested, and  Receive a written explanation with respect to any denied benefit claim regarding the reasons for such denial and the steps that must be taken in order to have such denial reviewed (For detailed explanation, refer to the Claims Review Procedure section within this Summary Plan Description.)     21  In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.  The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your employer, your union or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.  If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. You may obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and you have the right to have the Plan Administrator review and reconsider your claim, all within certain time schedules.  Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request, in writing, a copy of the Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive it within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you with the requested materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive such materials, unless materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.  If you have a claim for benefits that are denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.   In addition, if you disagree with the Plans decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order, you may file suit in federal court.  If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plans money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.  If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.        22  NOTICE  This Summary Plan Description is not meant to interpret, extend or change the Plan or Trust in any way.  In case of a conflict between this summary and the actual provisions of the Plan or Trust documents, the latter will govern your benefits and rights.  Each employee should understand that the employment relationship with the Company is an at-will relationship, and as such, may be terminated at any time by either party.  Nothing in this Summary Plan Description is intended to be an express or implied contract of employment, or guarantee of employment for a specific period of time between the employee and the Company, unless clearly so stated in a document signed by the parties.

This Plan is also intended to be an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), and provide you the opportunity to become a shareholder of the Company who participates in the growth of the Company.  The Plan, along with your pension plan, Social Security, and any other personal savings, can be an important source of income at retirement.  This summary highlights important provisions of the Plan.  More detailed information is contained in the Plan document, which governs in the event of any discrepancies.  Sherwin-Williams makes no guarantees or assurances regarding the performance of any investment option available through this Plan. The value of a participants account will ultimately be determined by the investment results of the fund or funds in which that participants account has been invested. The value of such account is not protected against loss.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PLAN  Savings Ease...  The amount you choose to contribute reduces your pay automatically - before you receive your paycheck.  Payroll contributions can be withdrawn BEFORE taxes are calculated (traditional 401(k)), or AFTER taxes are calculated (Roth 401(k)), which allows you to avoid federal income taxes on earnings related to these after-tax contributions.  You may be able to contribute up to 20% of your compensation to the Plan, subject to certain IRC limits.  Company Matching Contributions...  The Company contributes one dollar for each dollar you contribute to your account, up to 6% of your compensation (subject to certain IRC limits).  Company Matching Contributions will commence at the beginning of the quarter following your one-year anniversary with the Company.  Company Ownership... With contributions you may choose to invest in the Company Stock Fund, you can become a shareholder of the Company and share in the growth of the Company and its financial success.  Investment Choices... You choose how your contributions to the Plan are invested.  You can invest in one or more of the Plans investment options, which include a variety of money market, fixed income, equity and Company Stock funds.      7 Investment Changes...  Your account is valued at the end of every business day, which means you can generally change your investment mix as frequently as daily.  Flexibility If you leave the Company before you retire, you can roll over your Plan balance to another qualified plan arrangement.  Tax Advantage... When you save on a pre-tax basis, your contributions come out of your pay before taxes are withheld.  This means that you are taxed on less income.  You wont pay income taxes on your pre-tax contributions, Company Matching Contributions or any earnings until you withdraw them from your account.  With Roth after tax contributions, you will pay taxes on the money you contribute to the plan.  However, you dont pay federal income taxes on the gains related to your after-tax contributions to the Plan.  24 hour Access... You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Plans Customer Service Line at 1-800-323-4015 to get information about your account, to change your deferral elections, to change your investment elections, to transfer (exchange) funds, to request information about the investment options, and to request a total distribution from the Plan once you are eligible for such a distribution (i.e., termination or retirement).  ELIGIBILITY  As an employee of the Company, you become immediately eligible to participate in the Plan with no service requirement if you are:  a regular full time or part time employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company which has adopted the Plan, not a member of a collective bargaining unit unless eligibility for the Plan is extended to such members through negotiation, a citizen of the United States if you are working abroad, under certain circumstances described in the Plan, or a non-US citizen working in the United States.  Once you become eligible to participate, you will be mailed an enrollment package providing you with additional information on both the Plan and how to enroll.  For all new hires on and after January 1, 2005, if you meet the eligibility requirements, you will be automatically enrolled into the Plan approximately 45 days following your date of hire.  Your contributions to the Plan will be automatically established at 3% pre-tax (also known as 401(k)).  Prior to the time these automatic elections take effect, the Company will mail you a package providing you with additional information on both the Plan and how to change your pre-selected enrollment options or choose not to participate in the Plan.  If you choose not to change the automatic enrollment contribution level of 3% when you first become eligible for the Plan, your contribution level will increase at the beginning of      8 each year by 1%, until you either a) change your contribution level, or b) reach a 6% contribution level through this automatic increase function.  For participants who terminate employment and are later re-employed, special rules (called Break in Service Rules) apply.  Contact the Employee Benefits department if you have questions relating to participation upon re-employment.  ENROLLMENT   You will be automatically enrolled in the Plan once you meet the eligibility requirements.  To change your enrollment, log on to www.401k.com or call the Customer Service Support Line at 1-800-323-4015 on any business day between the hours of 8:30 AM and 12:00 Midnight and speak to a service representative.   When you contact the Customer Service Support group, you can:  establish a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be used to access your account in the future, change how much you want to contribute, as a percentage of your pay, change how you want to invest your contributions, and choose to have your Company stock fund dividends paid directly to you or reinvested within the Plan.  By accessing the web or calling Customer Service to enroll, you are authorizing the Company to deduct contributions from your pay.  Your deductions become effective as soon as administratively feasible.  Generally, the time between your deferral election to the time it is reflected in your paycheck is about three weeks.  By participating when first eligible, you should be able to realize maximum benefits from the Plan.  CHANGING YOUR DEFERRAL ELECTIONS  You can make or change your deferral elections on any business day.  Your changes become effective as soon as administratively feasible.  Generally, the time between your deferral election or change to the time it is reflected in your paycheck is about three weeks.  A written confirmation of your deferral percent change will be mailed to you.  CONTRIBUTIONS  Generally, you may contribute from 1% to 20% of your compensation to the Plan.  However, federal law prevents certain individuals from contributing in excess of specified limits per year.  Because contributions are based on a percentage, the dollar amount of your contributions will automatically change when there is a change in your base earnings. In addition, after you have been with the Company for at least one year, the Company Matching Contributions add one dollar for every payroll dollar you contribute, up to a maximum of 6% of your compensation.  Contributions you make, including Company Matching Contributions, will be promptly forwarded to the Plan trustee.      9   Pre-tax ContributionsPre-tax contributions (sometimes known as 401(k) contributions) allow you to contribute money to the Plan before it becomes part of your federal taxable income.  The result is a saving of current federal income tax liability, and in many cases, state and local taxes (depending on where you live and/or work).  Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income, which means your current income tax is lower.  However, there are restrictions on withdrawals for pre-tax contributions.  These restrictions are explained in the OBTAINING FUNDS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT section of this Summary Plan Description.   After-tax Contributions After-tax contributions (sometimes known as Roth 401(k) contributions) allow you to contribute money to the Plan after the contribution amount was considered for purposes of your federal taxable income.  Unlike pre-tax contributions, you will incur current federal income tax liability as well as state and local taxes (depending on where you live and/or work) related to these contributions.  However, you can avoid paying federal income taxes on any gains you earn relating to these after-tax contributions.  There are restrictions on withdrawals for after-tax contributions.  These restrictions are explained in the OBTAINING FUNDS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT section of this Summary Plan Description.  You can choose to contribute to the Plan on a pre-tax, after-tax, or a combination of pre-tax and after-tax.  However, your entire contribution to the plan will be limited based on the Limits to Contributions summarized below.  Limits to Contributions There are certain federal tax law limitations on the maximum amount you can contribute to the Plan in any calendar year.  These limits are subject to change each year, depending on inflation.  For 2008, the limit is $15,500.  Although you may contribute 20% of your annual compensation to the Plan, you will be limited to maximum contributions of $15,500.  Depending on your compensation, you may reach the $15,500 limit before the end of the calendar year.  If you do so, your contributions to the Plan will cease, and any Company Matching Contributions you would have otherwise been entitled to will also cease.    If you intend to contribute the maximum amount allowable under federal law to the Plan, you should carefully plan your contributions to the Plan each calendar year.  You will want to maximize your contributions to the Plan without exceeding the $15,500 limit by year-end and losing the ability to receive Company Matching Contributions.  Refer to the following example:   If your compensation in 2008 is expected to be $103,333 and you contribute 15% to the Plan, you will reach your maximum contribution to the Plan of $15,500 on your last paycheck of 2008.  However, if you contribute the maximum of 20% to the Plan, you will reach your maximum contributions of $15,500 well before the end of the year.  For the remainder of the year, you will no longer be able to contribute to the Plan, nor will you receive additional Company Matching    Contributions for that period of time.  Increases to federal tax law limitations on contributions are indexed to inflation.  Keep these limits in mind as you think about your Plan contributions.   Catch-up Contributions If you are age 50 or over, federal tax law and the Plan allow you to make additional contributions to the Plan.  These catch-up contributions are made to the Plan on either a pre-tax or after-tax basis, are NOT matched by the Company, and are not considered when determining your limits on how much you can contribute to the Plan.    In 2008, the Catch-up Contribution limit is $5,000.  Further increases to federal tax law limitations on catch-up contributions are indexed to inflation.  Refer to the following example:  If you are at least age 50 and your compensation in 2008 is expected to be $103,333 and you contribute 15% to the Plan, you will reach your maximum contribution to the Plan of $15,500 on your last paycheck of 2008.  However, you can choose to contribute an additional amount to the Plan for 2008 equal to $5,000.  Your year end combined contributions to the Plan will be $20,500.  Company Matching Contributions Company Matching Contributions help your savings grow faster.  For every dollar you contribute from each paycheck (excluding any and all catch-up contributions) up to a maximum of 6% of compensation, the Company adds one dollar to your account.  Company Matching Contributions will commence at the beginning of the quarter following your one-year anniversary with the Company.  Take a look at the following chart to see how quickly your savings can grow:      And you  The Company    For a Total If you earn...

You should contact the Plans Customer Support Line at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain the necessary form and instructions to initiate the rollover of these funds. As part of the rollover process, you will have the ability to invest in any Plan investment funds, unless the investment fund is closed to new participants by the fund manager.  Maximum Total Contributions In addition to the maximum applicable to pre-tax contributions, the IRS regulations restrict total contributions (employee and employer contributions for all retirement plans of the Company) each calendar year to the lesser of $46,000 (in 2008, which is subject to an annual adjustment) or 100% of your adjusted compensation. Adjustments to your compensation include the amount you contribute to the Plan on a pre-tax basis.

Once you begin contributing to the Plan and you have not directed your contributions to a specific investment, your contributions will be automatically invested in the Plans default fund. The Plans default fund will consist of a Fidelity Life Cycle Pool that closely matches your retirement date based on a projected retirement age of 65. This default fund may not provide the most appropriate risks vs rewards for your particular circumstances, so evaluating and selecting your investments is extremely important.

Company Matching Contributions can be directed to any investments available within the Plan.  If you choose not to direct your Company Matching contributions, these contributions will be invested in the Fidelity Life Cycle Pools.  Please remember, you always have the ability to exchange your Company Matching contributions to other investments within the Plan.           12 CHANGING INVESTMENT FUNDS  You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Customer Service Support Line at 1-800-323-4015 to transfer (exchange) a portion or all of your employee and employer account balance from one fund to another.

Requests received prior to 4:00 p.m. will receive that business days closing price. Also, while the available funds seldom have to interrupt the ability to transfer in and out, these funds, including the Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund, may modify or suspend the transfer (exchange) provision for a period of time to protect the interests of the funds shareholders. This may happen in instances where excessive trading or conversion out of an investment option can undermine the objective of the fund.  Each time you call and make a change you will receive a written confirmation of the change.  INVESTMENT OPTIONS  All the money that you and the Company contribute to the Plan is put into a fund held by the Plan Trustee and credited to an account in your name.  The Trustee credits your account and invests the funds in accordance with both the Plan provisions (with respect to Company Matching Contributions) and your instructions (with respect to your Pre-tax and/or After-tax Contributions, Catch-up Contributions and Rollover Contributions).  The Plan offers a broad range of investment options representing all the primary asset classes (short-term investments, bonds and stocks).  This list of funds includes the following:  Short-Term Investment Fund: Fidelity Retirement Government Money Market Fund  Bond Funds: Fidelity Managed Income Portfolio II Fidelity Institutional Short-Intermediate Government Fund Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund PIMCO Low Duration Institutional Fund Fidelity Inflation Protected Bond Fund  Stock Funds: Fidelity Puritan Fund Fidelity Equity Income Fund Mutual Shares  Class Z      13 Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund Fidelity Contrafund Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund Victory Diversified Stock Fund Class A American Funds Growth Fund of America Lord Abbett Small-Cap Value Fund Fidelity Diversified International Fund The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund  Life Cycle Pools: The Fidelity Pyramus Pooled investments are designed for the investor who wants to have their asset classes and investments professionally managed.

Notes on Investments For more complete information about any of the Plans mutual fund options, including fees and expenses, log on to www.401k.com or call the Customer Service Support Line at 1-800-323-4015 and ask for free prospectuses. Read them carefully before you make your investment choices.  Transaction requests received after 4 p.m. Eastern time or on weekends or holidays will receive the next business days closing price.  The mutual funds available through the Plan reserve the right to modify or withdraw the exchange privilege.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Risk vs. Reward Generally, riskier investments have the potential for greater return over the long term. However, they also have a greater potential for loss. Their value goes up and down as the markets change. Lower-risk investments may seem safer because they have a more stable value, but they may not provide enough earnings for you to reach your financial goals. As you review your investment options, think about the trade-offs you are willing to make between risk and return.  Diversification You can diversify any employee contribution made to The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund to any other investment fund available within the Plan at any time.         14 Beginning January 1, 2008 you can diversify your pre-2007 Company Matching contributions based on the following schedule:   January 1, 2007  33% of pre-2007 Company Matching contributions January 1, 2008  66% of pre-2007 Company Matching contributions January 1, 2009  100% of pre-2007 Company Matching contributions  In addition, if you have attained the age of 55 or older and the tenth anniversary of your Enrollment Date in the Plan, you may diversify 100% of your Company Matching Contributions invested in the Company Stock Fund to other investments available under the Plan. Such diversification can be accomplished at any time after you attain the age of 55 or older.  You have the ability to invest the diversifiable portion of your Company Matching Contributions in any of the Plan investment funds, unless the investment fund is closed to new participants by the fund manager.   Please note that once you move money out of the Company Stock Fund, you cannot exchange investments back to the Company Stock Fund.  Also, before you diversify out of the Company Stock Funds make sure you understand that you may lose certain tax benefits from owning the Company Stock Fund.  See the section FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION for more details.

OBTAINING FUNDS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT  The Plan is designed primarily for long term savings.  However, there are limited ways for you to obtain money from your account if you need it before retirement.  Loans You have the option to initiate a loan from your account if you are an active employee.  As long as you repay your loan in full and in accordance with its terms, a loan from the Plan will not be a taxable event.  The basic loan provisions are as follows: You may borrow a minimum of $1,000, up to a maximum of $50,000, or 50% of your vested balance, whichever is lower. The term of your loan may not exceed 5 years, unless youre using the loan to purchase a primary residence, in which case, it cannot exceed 10 years. The interest rate for the loan equals the prime interest rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal, plus one percent. You pay a maintenance fee for any outstanding loan.  The fee is deducted automatically from your account balance on a quarterly basis. You will pay back the loan, including principal and interest, through payroll deductions.  These payments are separate and are in addition to your contributions to the Plan.  The interest you pay (along with the principal) goes into your account. You may pay off your loan early without penalty. You may have only one outstanding loan at any time.   In determining the amount available for a loan, the Plan will look back one year to determine what, if any, was your largest outstanding loan balance.  This amount will be subtracted from the amount you would otherwise be eligible for based on the basic loan rules noted above.  Also, any outstanding loan you have must be repaid in full when you retire or leave the Company.  If you do not repay the loan within 90 days from date of termination or retirement, the amount outstanding will be considered a deemed distribution and will be taxable to you as if it were a Plan distribution.  You can initiate a loan transaction, or pay off a loan, by contacting the Customer Service Support Line at 1-800-323-4015.  The loan transaction will be processed over the phone      16 (except for loans that exceed 5 years, which will be processed by a form) and the resulting funds mailed to you generally within 7 to 10 business days.  Withdrawals As a Plan participant, you may be eligible for limited withdrawal options as well.  Please refer to the section FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION when considering a withdrawal of funds from your account.  Age 59  Withdrawal This withdrawal type is limited to employees who are age 59  or older.  You may withdraw up to 100% of your vested account balance, including your pre-tax contributions.  The minimum withdrawal is  $1,000.  You will be subject to income taxes (but not any excise tax) when you withdraw under this withdrawal type.  You may initiate an Age 59  Withdrawal once every 24 months.  After-Tax Withdrawal Roth 401(k) After-Tax Contributions  to avoid the payment of excise taxes, there are several limitations to accessing Roth 401(k) contributions, including a five (5) year waiting period from the point in which the contribution was made, and a minimum age 59  before access to these funds can be allowed.  You may initiate a non-Roth after-tax contribution withdrawal once every 24 months.  Hardship Withdrawal In accordance with IRS regulations, you must show evidence of serious financial hardship by submitting appropriate documentation to qualify for a Hardship Withdrawal. The Internal Revenue Service considers hardships to include certain medical expenses that qualify under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 213, purchase of a primary residence, post secondary tuition for yourself, your spouse, children or dependents, funds needed to prevent eviction or foreclosure on your home, certain funeral expenses or damage to a principal residence that qualifies for a casualty deduction under IRC Section 165.  You will be subject to taxes and a ten percent early withdrawal penalty when you withdraw (unless you are age 59  or older), and you will be suspended from making any contributions to the Plan for at least six months after your withdrawal.  The suspension of your contributions will occur as soon as administratively possible.  Full Distributions If you terminate employment with the Company for any reason, you may request a full distribution of your vested account balance or arrange a direct rollover.  If you do not arrange a direct rollover, you may be subject to taxes and a possible 10% early withdrawal penalty.  Withdrawal Options for Employees with Pre-2002 Balances      17 The following withdrawal options are only available for participants who are employees and have pre-2002 balances in their accounts.  Only the pre-2002 balances are eligible for these withdrawal options.  After-Tax Withdrawals - You may withdraw an amount up to 100% of your non-Roth after-tax contribution account. The minimum withdrawal is $1,000.  Depending on availability, the after-tax contribution withdrawal may include the following sources of money:  Pre-1987 After-tax Contributions - this money is available only to employees who made contributions on an after-tax basis prior to 1987.  There is no tax implication for withdrawing the Pre-1987 contribution portion. Post-1986 non-Roth After-tax Contributions - this money includes any after-tax contribution invested after 1986 that are not related to Roth 401k contributions.  According to the tax laws, you must withdraw a portion of earnings on Post 1986 contributions, and as a result, will pay income taxes on the earnings and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty on the earnings.   In-Service Withdrawals may be made with respect to certain pre-2002 contributions, with a minimum withdrawal of $1,000.  You will be subject to income tax and a possible 10% early withdrawal penalty on any earnings.  Depending on availability, an In-Service Withdrawal may include the following sources of money: After-tax Contributions, Rollover Contributions, and any Trustee Transfer Contributions from acquisition plans.  If you are fully vested, you may also withdraw your Company Matching and Company Bonus contributions under an in-service withdrawal.  You may initiate an In-Service Withdrawal once every 24 months.  You can call the Customer Service Support Line at 1-800-323-4015 to initiate any withdrawal from the Plan.  Withdrawals (other than Hardships) will be processed and the resulting funds mailed to you generally within 7 to 10 business days.  If you elect to receive a distribution in shares, the share certificate will be mailed to you generally within 15 to 20 business days.  Dividends Dividends on the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund:  To the extent your account is invested in units of The Sherwin Williams Company Stock Fund, you have the right to elect to receive any dividends paid by the Company on its common stock in for form of cash.  Alternatively, the dividends can be reinvested in The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund to purchase additional units.  If you do not make an active election to receive your dividends in cash, the related dividends will automatically be used to purchase additional units of the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund for your account.  Dividends on ESOP Leveraging Shares:  During such time when the Plan is leveraged under the ESOP loan provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations and the Company has made a contribution to repay the ESOP debt underlying the leveraging, you have the right to elect to receive a dividend equal to the total of your next      18 Pre-Tax Contribution and Company Matching Contribution.  You may make this election once per calendar year for a single pay period and when the Plan is leveraged as described in the previous sentence.  By making this election, amounts distributed to you as a dividend will be fully taxable and ineligible for rollover or transfer treatment.  Other Items If you terminate employment with the Company and your vested account balance is less than $1,000, such balance will be automatically distributed in accordance with the law.  If you terminate employment with the Company and your vested account balance is greater than $1,000, you may leave your balance in the Plan2.  However, the Plan and the IRC provide that a distribution of your account balance must commence no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you attain age 70  (unless you are still employed with the Company at such time).                                                             2 Plan participants who choose to leave their account balances in the Plan will be assessed a small record keeping fee equal to the cost the Company would otherwise pay for the participant as an active employee. Federal income taxes are withheld at a rate of 20% from all cash distributions, unless eligible rollover distributions are directly rolled over to another employers qualified plan or an individual retirement account (IRA).  Any required state tax withholding may also apply.  If you are withdrawing from The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund, you may request a distribution in cash or shares.  Please note, a withdrawal of shares will not result in the 20% mandatory withholding, and other special tax rules surrounding such a distribution may also apply.  FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION  The Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC, and to meet the requirements for an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  The related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the IRC. Contributions made by the Company on behalf of participants in the Plan are deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes.  Employee Contributions: Employee pre-tax (or 401(k)) contributions reduce the employees gross income and are not subject to federal income taxes at the time of contribution. However, employee pre-tax contributions will be subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes in the year of contribution.   Employee Rollover of Funds into the Plan: Employees may roll over into the Plan a taxable distribution from a prior employers qualified plan or a qualified conduit individual retirement account (IRA), provided the funds are (1) rolled over within 60 days from the date the employee received the distribution, or (2) received directly from      19 the trustee of the prior employers qualified plan or the IRA custodian or trustee. A conduit IRA is one that contains only funds distributed from a prior employers qualified plan plus the earnings thereon. The funds rolled into the Plan will be fully vested and nonforfeitable, but such funds do not qualify for employer matching contributions.  With respect to Plan loans and withdrawals, the rolled over funds are treated in the same manner as pre-tax contributions.  Employer Contributions: Company contributions on behalf of a contributing employee are not includible in the employees gross income, and are not subject to federal income, Social Security or Medicare taxes at the time of contribution.  Plan Earnings: Earnings or appreciation on employee Pre-Tax Contributions, employee non-Roth After-Tax Contributions and Company Matching Contributions are not subject to federal income tax until such amounts are withdrawn by the employee or are distributed to the employee upon termination of employment, or are distributed to a beneficiary in the event of the employees death.  Earnings or appreciation on Roth After-Tax contributions under current law are not subject to federal income taxes if the distribution is made in accordance with requirements of the law.    Withdrawals of Employee (Participant) non-Roth After-Tax Contributions:  If a participant withdraws after-tax contributions made prior to 1987, such amounts, being a return of after-tax contributions, will not be subject to federal income tax. If a participant withdraws non-Roth after-tax contributions made after 1986, such amounts will be treated in part as a distribution of after-tax contributions and in part as a distribution of earnings and appreciation. The withdrawal of after-tax contributions will not be subject to federal income tax, but the distribution of earnings and appreciation will be subject to federal income tax and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Withdrawals of Employee (Participant) Pre-Tax Contributions:  Withdrawals of pre-tax contributions may be made after the participant attains age 59  or incurs a separation of employment. Withdrawal of pre-tax contributions prior to the time the participant attains age 59  and while the participant is working for the employer is limited to hardship situations. Generally, a hardship exists only if a participant can demonstrate that there is an immediate and heavy financial need, and a withdrawal of pre-tax contributions is necessary to satisfy such financial need.  All withdrawals of pre-tax contributions are subject to federal income taxes and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Withdrawals of Employer (Company) Contributions: Withdrawals of employer contributions along with earnings and appreciation thereon will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Lump Sum Distributions upon Termination of Employment, including Retirement, Total Disability, and Death: The Plan provides that a distribution due to retirement, death, total disability, or other termination of employment may be made in a lump-sum distribution. The amount of the lump-sum distribution equal to the sum of after-tax      20 contributions not previously withdrawn is not subject to federal income tax. The amount of the lump-sum distribution in excess of after-tax contributions not previously withdrawn, including earnings and appreciation on company and employee contributions, is subject to federal income tax as ordinary income.  However, a qualifying lump-sum distribution may be eligible for special ten-year income averaging (if you were born prior to January 1, 1936) for federal income tax purposes.  If a distribution is taken in shares of Sherwin-Williams Company Stock, which is permitted as part of a lump-sum distribution, the excess, if any, of the fair market value of such Sherwin-Williams Stock over the cost of such Sherwin-Williams Stock is not subject to federal income taxes at the time of distribution, but generally will be subject to federal income tax upon subsequent disposition of the Sherwin-Williams Stock. A lump-sum distribution may be subject to penalty and excise taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Rollover of Distributions: A participant may defer federal income tax on all or any portion of a withdrawal (other than hardship distributions) or a lump-sum distribution that is rolled over to another qualified plan or to an IRA. A rollover can be made (1) by having the Plan trustee transfer all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution directly to another qualified plan or to the participants IRA, or (2) by having the Trustee distribute the full amount of a withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to the participant and the participant transfers all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to another qualified plan or to the participants IRA within 60 days after the participant receives the funds. If the Trustee transfers the funds to another qualified plan or the participants IRA, the funds transferred are not subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding. However, if the Trustee transfers the funds to the participant, the transferred funds are subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. A subsequent distribution from an IRA will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and will not qualify for special ten-year income averaging. Generally, the amount of the lump-sum distribution rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA will not be subject to excise or penalty taxes, but a subsequent distribution of a rolled over amount from another qualified plan or IRA may be subject to excise or penalty taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.   Penalty and Excise Taxes: Unless certain exceptions apply, the taxable portion of any withdrawal, or the taxable portion of a lump-sum distribution that is not rolled over may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the distribution is made before the employee attains age 59 .  The federal tax information contained in this booklet briefly explains the federal tax aspects of participation in the Plan. The federal tax laws regarding participation in the Plan are extremely complex and no attempt has been made here to deal with the many special provisions that could be applicable to a particular situation or with the rules governing state, local or foreign taxes. Participants should consult their own counsel or other tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences to them or their beneficiaries.

Participants who exercise discretion over the Plan account investments do so with the understanding that they are prudent investors who have been given, and have reviewed, appropriate information on the fund or funds in which they are directing their investments.       23 You May Not Assign or Alienate Your Account The Plan does not permit you or your beneficiary to assign, alienate, sell, transfer, or pledge the benefits under the Plan to a creditor or to anyone else, nor may any person create a lien on any funds, securities or other property held by the Plan, except in the case of Member Loans through the Plan. These provisions do not apply, however, in cases of certain qualified domestic relations court orders which create rights to Plan benefits for spouses, former spouses, children or other dependents of participants.  Qualified Domestic Relations Order If, as a result of a divorce, you are responsible for child support, alimony or marital property rights payments, all or part of your savings plan benefits may be assigned to meet these payments if a qualified domestic relations order, which the Plan Administrator determines complies with the terms of the Plan, has been issued by a court.  Participants and beneficiaries can obtain, without a charge, copies of such procedures from the Plan Administrator.  Voting of Sherwin-Williams Shares You are entitled to vote your portion of The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund. You will receive the following material before each annual or special shareholders meeting:  A copy of the proxy soliciting material for the meeting. A form on which you can instruct the trustee as to how to vote your allocated shares of Sherwin-Williams stock.  The trustee will vote the shares as instructed. In addition, the trustee will vote the shares for which it does not receive voting instructions in the same proportions as the shares for which it does receive instructions.  Administrator of the Plan The Plan text, trust agreement and the annual report are available for review by Plan participants or their beneficiaries at the Employee Benefits office of The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio 44115 during normal working hours. Upon written request addressed to the Administration Committee, copies of these documents will be furnished, at a reasonable charge, to you as a Plan participant or your beneficiary. This booklet summarizes the main provisions of the Plan in non-technical language. It is not intended to give complete details, especially those details that apply to only a few employees. Full details of the Plan are contained in the legal Plan document.  In the event of any discrepancy between the Plan document and this booklet or in the event of an ambiguity in this booklet, the more detailed provisions of the Plan will govern.  Plan Expenses All administrative expenses and fees incident to the operation and management of the Plan and the Trust Fund, and other costs of purchases and sales under the various investment funds which are charged to such funds, or to the participant accounts, may be paid by the Company, but if not paid by the Company, they shall be paid from the Plan.       24 Participants not employed by the Company and maintaining a balance in the Plan may have costs associated with administrative expenses incident to the operation and management of their account in the Plan charged directly to their account.  Missing Participants or Beneficiaries If you leave the employment of the Company, it is your responsibility to advise the Plan Trustee of any changes in your address. Address changes for terminated employees can be made by contacting the Plans Customer Service Support line at 1-800-323-4015. Neither the Administration Committee nor the Trustee shall be required to search for or locate a participant or beneficiary.  If you do not apply for benefits within 90 days of normal retirement date, your account may be forfeited.  It will be reinstated if you or your beneficiary request that your benefits be paid out.  Top-Heavy Rules This Plan contains rules that would take effect automatically for any year in the unlikely event that the Plan becomes top-heavy. A top-heavy plan is one in which the total accounts for certain key (highly-paid) employees exceed 60% of the total accounts for all employees under the Plan. The top-heavy rules provide for, among other things, accelerated vesting of accounts and minimum contribution levels for participants.  The Plan Administrator will advise you of your rights under the top-heavy rules if the Plan becomes top-heavy.  Plan Continuation The Company intends to continue the Plan indefinitely but reserves the right to discontinue the Plan at any time. If the Company terminates the Plan for any reason, the accounts of all members will be used for the exclusive benefit of Plan participants and their beneficiaries. If the Plan either partially or fully terminates, all Plan participants will become fully vested as of the date of such termination and you will receive your distribution according to the terms of the Plan.   The Company can also amend the Plan, at its discretion at any time, or as the law requires.  Claims Review Procedure If your claim for benefits is denied (including any case where you do not think your benefits are properly determined), you may ask the Administration Committee to reconsider the matter within 60 days after receiving a notice of denial. If the Administration Committee does not feel that the circumstances warrant any different action from that taken, you will be furnished with a written notice explaining: Specific reasons for the decision. Specific reference to the pertinent provision of the Plan document on which the decision is based. Any additional information or facts necessary to complete your claim and an explanation of why such additional information is necessary. Your right to appeal the decision.  You will usually be notified within 120 days of your request. If special circumstances require an extension of time, you will be notified before the expiration of the 120-day      25 period of the special circumstances and the date (not later than an additional 120 days) by which you will receive a decision.  Within 60 days after you receive a written notification of the decision from the Administration Committee, you or your duly authorized representative may: File a written appeal to The Sherwin-Williams Company Administration Committee, The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio 44115, for a full and fair review. Review pertinent documents. Submit issues and comments in writing. A written decision will usually be made by the Administration Committee within 60 days after it receives your request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing) require an extension of time for not more than an additional 60 days. The decision on review will include the specific reasons for the  decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.  ERISA Rights The Plan is an individual account plan under which a participants benefits are based solely upon the amount contributed to the participants account, and any income, gains and losses that may be allocated to that account. The Plan is subject to some, but not all, of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The Plan is generally subject to the provisions of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA which, among other things, require that each participant be furnished with a comprehensive description of his or her rights under the Plan and an annual report of financial condition of the Plan, establish minimum standards for participation and vesting of benefits, and set standards of fiduciary responsibility. The Plan is not subject to ERISA requirements regarding funding, but by its nature the Plan is fully funded at all times. As an individual account plan, the Plan is excluded from coverage under Title IV of ERISA that provides for the guaranty of certain benefits of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrators office and at other principal offices of the Company, all documents governing the Plan and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration. Obtain copies, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, of all Plan documents governing the operation of the Plan, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. These copies shall be subject to a reasonable charge. Receive a summary of the Plans annual financial report.  The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. Receive annually a statement of your vested benefits or the earliest date on which benefits will become vested. Receive a written explanation with respect to any denied benefit claim regarding      26 the reasons for such denial and the steps that must be taken in order to have such denial reviewed (For detailed explanation, refer to the Claims Review Procedure section within this Summary Plan Description.)  In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.  The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your employer, your union or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.  If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial, you may obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and you have the right to have the Plan Administrator review and reconsider your claim, all within certain time schedules.  Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request, in writing, a copy of the Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive it within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you with the requested materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive such materials, unless materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.  If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.   In addition, if you disagree with the Plans decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order, you may file suit in federal court.  If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plans money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.  If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the Office of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration.

The Plan may exist indefinitely, but Sherwin-Williams can terminate or amend the Plan at any time.

This prospectus also includes information about the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund that is one of the investment options under the Plan. This prospectus covers up to 33,000,000 Sherwin-Williams Shares plus the Sherwin-William Shares registered under the initial registration statement for the Plan and an indeterminate amount of participation interests in the Plan itself.   Capitalized terms used in this prospectus will be defined the first time they are used.  If any conflict exists between this prospectus and the Plan document, the Plan document will always govern and be followed in the actual determination of your benefits.      The Sherwin-Williams Administration Committee (the Committee) has overall responsibility for the operation and administration of the Plan.  The Committee may delegate responsibilities to others to carry out its duties. The Sherwin-Williams Fund Review and Management Committee  (the Fund Committee), appointed by the Board of Directors of Sherwin-Williams, selects the investment options available under the Plan from time to time.  Participants in the Plan can get information about the Plan and its administrators by contacting the Plans Customer Service Line at 1-800-323-4015 or logging on to www.401k.com.  This Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and is intended to be qualified under Sections 401(a), 401(k), 401(m) and 4975(e)(7) of the Code.   Sherwin-Williams offers eligible employees the right to participate in the Plan.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  Making Investment Decisions  Investment Fund Performance  Expenses  Taxes  Special Provisions Applicable to Puerto Rico Residents  Restrictions on Resale of Sherwin-Williams Shares  Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference   THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE AND SAVINGS PLAN 1     Making Investment Decisions  The Fund Committee selects all of the investment options available under the Plan other than the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund, and the Fund Committee may establish or discontinue any investment option at any time, other than the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund, which is specifically provided for in the Plan.  Please read carefully the separate investment option materials, which include a description and prospectus of each investment option, to determine which investment option or combination of investment options is right for you.  More information regarding investment options can be found in the Plan Enrollment Guide.  While the Fund Committee decides which investment options to make available to you under the Plan, its up to you to select the option(s) in which you will invest your contributions.  You can invest in one or more of the Plans investment options, which include a variety of money market, fixed income, equity and the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund.  Sherwin-Williams will provide you with information on the options but cannot give you investment advice.  You can always change your investment direction, including exchanging previously contributed funds, on any business day by logging on to www.401k.com or calling the Plans Customer Service Support Line at 1-800-323-4015.  Keep in mind that any investment carries a degree of risk.  The annual rate of return on your investment will vary depending on the options in which you invest.  How the options have performed in the past does not guarantee that those results will continue in the future.  You should also carefully and periodically evaluate the amount of your accounts invested in the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund.  You want to ensure that the amount of your investment in the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund does not exceed a percentage of your overall retirement savings that is appropriate for your individual situation.  For reference, you should note that Company stock in the Sherwin-Williams Stock Fund is purchased under the Plan at the Fair Market Value of such stock.   In providing you with information about the investment options/funds, through Fidelity or otherwise, neither the Fund Committee nor Sherwin-Williams is acting in an advisory capacity with regard to your investment in any particular fund nor guaranteeing that any fund will meet its investment objective.  You should consider your own investment goals and, if necessary, consult your own investment advisor for advice on the selection of any particular investment option/fund.  It is up to you to monitor the investment options performance and to make investment elections that meet your own financial goals.  You are responsible for your investment choices.  Neither Fidelity nor Sherwin-Williams is responsible for any losses that result from your investment decisions.      2     Investment Fund Performance The following table shows the year-over year investment performance for each of the investment choices presented as the percentage increase or decrease in the asset value of the investment choice.  Where performance data is not provided, data is not available based on the inception date of the fund.  For example, the T.

This includes costs of purchases and sales under the various investment funds which are charged to the funds, the costs associated with the administration of the unitized Company stock fund, and commissions on the unitized trading of Company stock.  The administrative expenses allocable to the account of a particular participant may be charged to the participants account, as directed by the Administration Committee.  These expenses may include such items as loan fees and domestic relations order review. Participants not employed by the Company and maintaining a balance in the Plan may have costs associated with administrative expenses incident to the operation and management of their account in the Plan charged directly to their account. Taxes  The following summary of the principal federal income tax consequences of participation in the Plan for the typical participant is based on the pertinent provisions of the Code, the applicable Treasury regulations, and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code and regulations.   You should be aware that the Code, regulations and such interpretations are subject to change and that such changes may be applied retroactively. The discussion does not cover foreign, state, local or other tax consequences of participation in the Plan, which could be very important to a participants overall planning.  Moreover, the tax effects of participation in the Plan may vary depending on the facts and circumstances pertaining to each participant. You should consult your own tax advisor or financial planner concerning the tax consequences to you of participation in the Plan when making any contribution, withdrawal or distribution election under the Plan. The Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and to meet the requirements for an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  The related trust is exempt from    4     federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.  Contributions made by Sherwin-Williams on behalf of participants in the Plan are deductible by Sherwin-Williams for federal income tax purposes.  Contributions:   Your Pre-Tax Contributions: Your pre-tax (or 401(k)) contributions will reduce your gross income and will not be subject to federal income taxes at the time of contribution so long as the Plan remains qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.  However, your pre-tax contributions will be subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes in the year of contribution.   Your Roth After-Tax Contributions: Roth after-tax contributions (or Roth 401(k) contributions) allow you to contribute money to the Plan after the contribution amount was considered for purposes of your federal taxable income. Unlike pre-tax contributions, you will incur federal income tax liability as well as state and local taxes (depending on where you live and/or work) related to these contributions when they are made.    Contributions by Sherwin-Williams:  Contributions made by Sherwin-Williams on your behalf are not includible in your gross income, and are not subject to federal income, Social Security or Medicare taxes at the time of contribution. Your Rollover of Funds into the Plan: You may rollover into the Plan a taxable distribution from a prior employers qualified plan or a qualified conduit individual retirement account (IRA), provided the funds are (1) rolled over within 60 days from the date you received the distribution, or (2) received directly from the trustee of the prior employers qualified plan or the IRA custodian or trustee.  A conduit IRA is one that contains only funds distributed from a prior employers qualified plan plus the earnings thereon.  The funds rolled into the Plan will be fully vested and nonforfeitable, but such funds do not qualify for employer matching contributions.  With respect to Plan loans and withdrawals, the rolled over funds are treated in the same manner as pre-tax contributions.  Plan Earnings: Earnings or appreciation on your pre-tax contributions, your non-Roth after-tax contributions and Sherwin-Williams matching contributions are not subject to federal income tax until such amounts are withdrawn by you or are distributed to you upon termination of employment, or are distributed to your beneficiary in the event of your death.  Earnings or appreciation on Roth after-tax contributions under current law are not subject to federal income taxes if the distribution is made in accordance with requirements of the law.   Withdrawals and Distributions:   Withdrawals of Your Pre-Tax Contributions: Withdrawals of employer contributions along with earnings and appreciation thereon will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes below.     5      Withdrawals of Your After-Tax Contributions: If you withdraw after-tax contributions made prior to 1987, such amounts, being a return of after-tax contributions, will not be subject to federal income tax.  If you withdraw non-Roth after-tax contributions made after 1986, such amounts will be treated in part as a distribution of after-tax contributions and in part as a distribution of earnings and appreciation.  The withdrawal of after-tax contributions will not be subject to federal income tax, but the distribution of earnings and appreciation will be subject to federal income tax and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes below.  Lump Sum Distributions upon Termination of Employment, including Retirement, Total Disability, and Death:  The Plan provides that a distribution due to retirement, death, total disability, or other termination of employment may be made in a lump-sum distribution. The amount of the lump-sum distribution equal to the sum of after-tax contributions not previously withdrawn is not subject to federal income tax. The amount of the lump-sum distribution in excess of after-tax contributions not previously withdrawn, including earnings and appreciation on company and employee contributions, is subject to federal income tax as ordinary income.  However, a qualifying lump-sum distribution may be eligible for special ten-year income averaging (if you were born prior to January 1, 1936) for federal income tax purposes.  If a distribution is taken in shares of Sherwin-Williams Shares, which is permitted as part of a lump-sum distribution, the excess, if any, of the fair market value of such Sherwin-Williams Shares over the cost of such Sherwin-Williams Shares is not subject to federal income taxes at the time of distribution, but generally will be subject to federal income tax (which may be capital gain rather than ordinary income) upon subsequent disposition of the Sherwin-Williams Shares. A lump-sum distribution may be subject to penalty and excise taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes below.   Rollover of Distributions:  You may defer federal income tax on all or any portion of a withdrawal (other than hardship distributions and minimum required distribution amounts) or a lump-sum distribution that is rolled over to another qualified plan or to an IRA (including a Roth IRA). A rollover can be made (1) by having the Plan trustee transfer all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution directly to another qualified plan or to your IRA, or (2) by having the trustee distribute the full amount of a withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to you and you transfer all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to another qualified plan or to your IRA within 60 days after you receive the funds. If the Plan trustee transfers the funds to another qualified plan or to your IRA, the funds transferred are not subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding. However, if the trustee transfers the funds to you, the transferred funds are subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. A subsequent distribution from an IRA will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and will not qualify for special ten-year income averaging. Generally, the amount of the lump-sum distribution rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA will not be subject to excise or penalty taxes, but a subsequent distribution of a rolled over amount from another qualified plan or IRA may be subject to excise or penalty taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes below.     6     Penalty and Excise Taxes: Unless certain exceptions apply, the taxable portion of any withdrawal, or the taxable portion of a lump-sum distribution that is not rolled over may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the distribution is made before you attain age 59 . There are a number of exceptions to the 10% penalty tax, not all listed below.  In particular, the 10% penalty tax does not apply:  If you separate from the Company in or after the year in which you reach age 55 and receive a distribution from the Plan following your separation.  If a distribution is made to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order.  If the distribution is a qualified reservist distribution.  The federal tax information contained in this prospectus briefly explains the federal tax aspects of participation in the Plan.  The federal tax laws regarding participation in the Plan are extremely complex and no attempt has been made here to deal with the many special provisions that could be applicable to a particular situation or with the rules governing state, local or foreign taxes.  You should consult with your own counsel or other tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences to you or your beneficiaries. Special Provisions Applicable to Puerto Rico Residents If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico law applies to your account as well as United States law.  Therefore, some Plan provisions may be different for you than for other participants.  These special provisions are described below:   If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, you may only make pre-tax 401(k) contributions to the Plan.  You are not eligible to make Roth 401(k) contributions.   Puerto Rico law limits the total contributions you may make each year to the Plan and to an IRA.  Therefore, if you are a resident of Puerto Rico and make contributions to an IRA, the amount you may contribute to the Plan as 401(k) contributions may be further limited because of your contributions to the IRA.  The combined limit under Puerto Rico law is the total of the limit applicable under United States law (described above) plus the limit applicable to plans that are qualified only in Puerto Rico.  For 2015, this limit is $15,000 (adjusted annually).  Therefore, your 401(k) contributions for 2015 plus your 2015 contributions to an IRA cannot exceed $20,000 (adjusted annually).   If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, the catch-up contribution limit is $1,500 for years beginning after 2011.   In addition, there are special tax rules in Puerto Rico that affect your distribution.  The following summary of the principal Puerto Rico income tax consequences of participation in the Plan, which apply to participants who are residents of Puerto Rico, is based on the pertinent provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for a New Puerto Rico of 2011 (the Puerto Rico Code).  You should be aware that the Puerto Rico Code is subject to change and that such changes may be applied retroactively.  The Puerto Rico tax effects of participation in the Plan may vary depending on the facts and circumstances pertaining to each Participant.  You should consult your own tax    7     advisor or financial planner concerning the Puerto Rico tax consequences to you of participation in the Plan when making any contribution, withdrawal, or distribution election under the Plan. Pre-Tax Contributions: Your pre-tax 401(k) contributions to the Plan ordinarily will not be immediately taxed as ordinary income so long as the Plan remains qualified under the Puerto Rico Code.  However, any portion of your pre-tax 401(k) contributions distributed to you from the Plan to satisfy the discrimination requirements of the Puerto Rico Code or to satisfy other limits of the Puerto Rico Code will be currently taxable to you. Employer Contributions: You will not be taxed immediately on Sherwin-Williamss contributions to the Plan on your behalf or on dividends or other income that is credited to your account so long as the Plan remains tax-qualified.  You will be taxed on these amounts in the manner described below when they are actually distributed to you. Withdrawal or Distributions: When you receive a withdrawal or distribution from your account, you will owe Puerto Rico income taxes on the amount that has not yet been taxed except for the portion of a total distribution (as defined below) that is transferred to another employer plan qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code or to an individual retirement account or annuity under Section 1081.02 of the Puerto Rico Code.  The amount withdrawn or distributed, but not rolled over to another qualified plan or individual retirement account or annuity, including your pre-tax, employer, and rollover contributions, and any investment earnings in your account, will be included in your gross income and taxed as ordinary income, subject to the exceptions set forth below. All or a portion of a total distribution may be transferred to a nondeductible individual retirement account under Section 1081.03 of the Puerto Rico Code, but the transferred amount will be subject to tax, although the tax obligation will be considered to have been satisfied by the withholding of tax on the distribution if the remainder of the distribution is transferred to the nondeductible individual retirement account.  After-tax contributions included in a withdrawal or distribution are not taxed.  If a withdrawal or distribution constitutes only part of your account, an allocable portion of your after-tax contributions generally is included in the withdrawal or distribution.   If your total account is distributed within a single taxable year due to your separation from service or plan termination (a total distribution), the amount of the total distribution in excess of the amount of your after-tax contributions is considered as long-term capital gain subject to a tax of 20%.   If your total distribution includes Sherwin-Williams Shares, that portion of the total distribution consisting of Sherwin-Williams Shares is not subject to tax at the time of distribution.  For purposes of determining the amount of gain or loss upon a future disposition of the Sherwin-Williams Shares, your basis in the shares is equal to the amount of your after-tax contributions (not otherwise taken into account for purposes of the 10% capital gain tax applied to total distributions from trusts invested in Puerto Rico assets).   If your distribution is made after separation from service in the form of periodic payments, the distribution will be exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation in an amount    8     up to $11,000 per year ($15,000 per year if you attain age 60 or over as of the last day of the year).   A total distribution generally is subject to withholding of 20% of the amount of the distribution in excess or your after-tax contributions. The withholding rate is 10% with respect to a total distribution that meets the Puerto Rico investment requirements set forth above.  Withholding tax does not apply to that portion of a total distribution consisting of Sherwin-Williams Shares, and withholding tax does not apply to the portion of a total distribution that is transferred directly to an individual retirement account or annuity under the provisions of Section 1081.02 of the Puerto Rico Code, to a nondeductible individual retirement account under Section 1081.03 of the Puerto Rico Code, or not another employer plan qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code.   Partial distributions made after your separation from service and withdrawals made before separation from service are subject to 10% withholding on amounts in excess of your after-tax contributions.  However, if your distribution is in the form of an annuity or periodic payments by reason of a separation from service, including required minimum distributions, withholding does not apply to the taxable amount of the distribution up to $21,000 for 2012, $23,500 for 2013, $26,500 for 2014, and $31,000 for 2015 and subsequent years ($25,000 for 2012, $27,500 for 2013, $30,500 for 2014, and $35,000 for 2015 and subsequent years if you attain age 60 or over by the end of the year) Sherwin-Williams Deduction: Assuming the Plan remains qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code, Sherwin-Williams will generally be entitled to a Puerto Rico income tax deduction equal to the amount it contributes to the Plan. Restrictions on Resale of Sherwin-Williams Shares Non-affiliates of Sherwin-Williams are free from restrictions on the resale of Sherwin-Williams Shares.  Affiliates of Sherwin-Williams are restricted in the resale of Sherwin-Williams Shares.  Restrictions on resale of Sherwin-Williams Shares under the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act include a limitation on the amount of Sherwin-Williams Shares which may be resold in any three-month period, a limitation on the manner of sale and an obligation to file a notice with the SEC.  An affiliate may also sell Sherwin-Williams Shares under a separate, current resale registration statement. This prospectus may not be used for the resale of Sherwin-Williams Shares acquired under the Plan by persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Sherwin-Williams, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. The definition of affiliate only includes persons who directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, Sherwin-Williams.  The determination of who is an affiliate will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case.   Plan participants who are executive officers of Sherwin-Williams should be aware that under certain circumstances transactions under the Plan involving Sherwin-Williams Shares could result in liability for any profits realized in connection with these transactions in accordance with Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).  Executive officers are also required to report changes in their ownership of Sherwin-Williams Shares on Forms 4    9     and 5.  Certain Sherwin-Williams employees should also be aware that they are subject to quarterly blackout periods in accordance with Company policy.

This Plan is also intended to be an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and provide you the opportunity to become a shareholder of the Company who participates in the growth of The Sherwin-Williams Company (Sherwin-Williams or the Company).  The Plan, along with your pension plan, Social Security, and any other personal savings, can be an important source of income at retirement.  The Plans Recordkeeper is Fidelity Management Trust Company (Recordkeeper).  This Summary Plan Description (SPD) describes provisions of the Plan as in effect on April 1, 2015, for participants employed by Sherwin-Williams on and after that date.  Plan details for participants separating from employment prior to that date may be different.  This summary highlights important provisions of the Plan.  More detailed information is contained in the Plan document, which governs in the event of any discrepancies.  Sherwin-Williams makes no guarantees or assurances regarding the performance of any investment option available through this Plan. The value of a participants account will ultimately be determined by the investment results of the fund or funds in which that participants account has been invested. The value of such account is not protected against loss.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PLAN  Savings Ease...  The amount you choose to contribute reduces your pay automatically - before you receive your paycheck.  You can elect to make your payroll contributions in two ways:  as pre-tax contributions made BEFORE taxes are calculated (traditional 401(k) contributions), or as Roth 401(k) contributions made AFTER taxes are calculated.  The Roth 401(k) option may allow you not to owe federal income taxes on earnings related to these after-tax contributions.  You may contribute up to 25% of your compensation to the Plan, subject to certain Internal Revenue Code limits.  Company Matching Contributions...  The Company provides attractive matching contributions so that your savings will grow even faster.    Company Matching Contributions will generally begin at the beginning of the quarter following your one-year anniversary with the Company.  Company Ownership... With contributions you invest in the Company Stock Fund, through the Plan you can become a shareholder of the Company and share in the growth of the Company and its financial success.         4 Investment Choices... You choose how your contributions to the Plan are invested.  You can invest in one or more of the Plans investment options, which include a variety of money market, fixed income, equity and Company Stock funds.  Investment Changes...  Your account is valued at the end of every business day, which means you can generally change your investment mix as frequently as daily.  Flexibility If you leave the Company before you retire, you can roll over your Plan balance to another qualified plan arrangement.  Tax Advantage... When you save on a pre-tax basis, your contributions come out of your pay before taxes are withheld.  This means that you are taxed on less income.  You will not pay income taxes on your pre-tax contributions, Company Matching Contributions or any earnings until you withdraw them from your account.  With Roth after tax contributions, you will pay taxes on the money you contribute to the Plan.  However, you generally will not be required to pay federal income taxes on the gains related to your after-tax contributions to the Plan, provided that you meet certain requirements.  24 hour Access... You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to get information about your account, to change your deferral elections, to change your investment elections, to transfer (exchange) funds, to request information about the investment options, and to request a total distribution from the Plan once you are eligible for such a distribution (i.e., upon your termination of employment, including retirement).  ELIGIBILITY  As an employee of the Company, you become immediately eligible to participate in the Plan and make contributions with no service requirement if you are:   an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company to which the Plan has been extended,  not a member of a collective bargaining unit unless eligibility for the Plan is extended to such members through negotiation, and  employed in the United States or a citizen of the United States (if you are working abroad).  A one year service requirement applies to eligibility to receive Company Matching Contributions, as noted below.  If you have a break in service, special rules may apply.  ENROLLMENT  Automatic Enrollment, Reenrollment, and Increases Once you become eligible to participate, you will be mailed an enrollment package providing you with additional information on both the Plan and how to enroll.     5  If you are hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2005, and otherwise meet the eligibility requirements, you will be automatically enrolled into the Plan approximately 45 days following your date of hire.  Your contributions to the Plan will be automatically established at 3% of your compensation on a pre-tax basis (also known as 401(k)).  Prior to the time these automatic elections take effect, the Company will mail you a package providing you with additional information on both the Plan and how to change your pre-selected enrollment options or choose not to participate in the Plan.  If you choose not to change the automatic enrollment contribution level of 3% when you first become eligible for the Plan, your contribution level will increase at the beginning of each year by 1%, until you either a) change your contribution level, or b) reach a 10% contribution level through this automatic increase function.    For participants who terminate employment and are later re-employed, special rules (called Break in Service Rules) apply.  Contact the Employee Benefits Service Center if you have questions relating to participation upon re-employment.  Since you will be automatically enrolled in the Plan once you meet the eligibility requirements, you should know that to change your enrollment, simply log on to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 on any business day between the hours of 8:30 AM and 12:00 Midnight and speak to a service representative.   When you contact the Recordkeeper, you can:   establish a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be used to access your account in the future,  change how much you want to contribute, as a percentage of your pay,  change from pre-tax to after-tax Roth contributions,  change how you want to invest your contributions, and  choose to have your Company stock fund dividends paid directly to you or reinvested within the Plan.  By accessing the web or calling to enroll, you are authorizing the Company to deduct contributions from your pay.  Your deductions become effective as soon as administratively feasible.  Generally, the time between your deferral election and the time it is reflected in your paycheck is about three weeks.  By participating when first eligible, you should be able to realize maximum benefits from the Plan.  CHANGING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS  You can make or change your deferral elections on any business day.  Your changes become effective as soon as administratively feasible, but as noted above, the time between your deferral election change to the time it is reflected in your paycheck is generally about three weeks.  A written confirmation of your deferral percent change will be mailed to you.        6 CONTRIBUTIONS  Generally, you may contribute from .5% to 25% of your compensation to the Plan, in increments of half or whole percentages.  For purposes of the Plan, your compensation generally includes your W-2 earnings and any pre-tax contributions you make to a Company tax-qualified retirement, health, or insurance plan. However, federal law prevents certain individuals from contributing in excess of specified limits per year.  Because contributions are based on a percentage, the dollar amount of your contributions will automatically change when there is a change in your earnings.   In addition, after you have been with the Company for at least one year and become eligible for the matching features of the Plan, the Company Matching Contributions will add additional dollars to your account.  Information on the amount of the Company Matching Contributions will be discussed later in this SPD.   The contributions that you elect to make will be promptly forwarded to the Plan trustee for investment in the Plan.  Any Company Matching Contributions for which you qualify are also deposited with the trustee.  Pre-tax Contributions Pre-tax contributions (sometimes known as traditional 401(k) contributions) allow you to contribute money to the Plan before it becomes part of your federal taxable income.  The result is a saving of current federal income tax liability, and in many cases, state and local taxes (depending on where you live and/or work).  Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income, which means your current income tax is lower.  However, there are restrictions on withdrawals for pre-tax contributions.  These restrictions are explained in the OBTAINING FUNDS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT section of this Summary Plan Description.   Roth After-tax Contributions After-tax contributions (sometimes known as Roth or Roth 401(k) contributions) allow you to contribute money to the Plan after the contribution amount was considered for purposes of your federal taxable income.  Unlike pre-tax contributions, you will incur current federal income tax liability as well as state and local taxes (depending on where you live and/or work) related to these contributions when they are made.  However, you may not have to pay federal income taxes on any gains you earn relating to these after-tax contributions if you meet requirements relating to Roth 401(k) withdrawals.  There are restrictions on withdrawals for after-tax contributions.  These restrictions are explained in the OBTAINING FUNDS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT section of this Summary Plan Description.  You can choose to contribute to the Plan on a pre-tax, after-tax, or a combination of pre-tax and after-tax.  However, your entire contribution to the Plan will be limited based on the Limits to Contributions summarized below.  Limits to Contributions There are certain federal tax law limitations on the maximum amount you can contribute to the Plan in any calendar year.  These limits are subject to change each year, depending on inflation.  For 2015, the limit is $18,000 (adjusted annually).  Although you may contribute 25% of your annual compensation to the Plan, you will be limited to maximum     7 contributions of $18,000.  Depending on your compensation, you may reach the $17,500 limit before the end of the calendar year.  If you do so, your contributions to the Plan will cease, and any Company Matching Contributions you would have otherwise been entitled to will also cease.    If you intend to contribute the maximum amount allowable under federal law to the Plan, you should carefully plan your contributions to the Plan each calendar year.  You will want to maximize your contributions to the Plan without exceeding the $18,000 limit by year-end and losing the ability to receive Company Matching Contributions.    Increases to federal tax law limitations on contributions are indexed to inflation.  Keep these limits in mind as you think about your Plan contributions.   Catch-up Contributions If you reach age 50 before the end of a Plan year, federal tax law and the Plan allow you to make additional contributions (over the $18,000 limit for 2015 described in the previous paragraph) to the Plan during that Plan year.  These catch-up contributions are made to the Plan on either a pre-tax or after-tax basis.    In 2015, the Catch-up Contribution limit is $6,000.  Further increases to federal tax law limitations on catch-up contributions are indexed to inflation.    Company Matching Contributions Company Matching Contributions help your savings grow faster.  For every pre-tax or Roth 401(k) dollar you contribute from each paycheck (excluding catch-up contributions) up to 6% of compensation, the Company will match your contributions.   Remember, Company Matching Contributions generally begin with the quarter following your one year anniversary with the Company.  Take a look at the following chart to see how quickly your savings can grow:         And You     The Company      For a Total If you earn...

The amount of these distributions may vary, and the Company may not provide such distributions in any given Plan year.  Rollover Contributions You can choose at any time after becoming a Plan participant to roll over funds from a prior employer plan.  You should contact the Plans Customer Support Line at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain the necessary form and instructions to initiate the rollover of these funds. As part of the rollover process, you will have the ability to invest in any Plan investment funds, unless the investment fund is closed to new participants by the fund manager.  Maximum Total Contributions In addition to the maximum applicable to pre-tax contributions, the IRS regulations restrict total contributions (employee and employer contributions for all retirement plans of the Company) each calendar year to the lesser of $53,000 (in 2015, which is subject to an annual adjustment) (not, however, including Catch-up Contributions) or 100% of your adjusted compensation. Adjustments to your compensation include the amount you contribute to the Plan on a pre-tax basis.  DIRECTING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS  To direct the investment of your contributions to the Plan, you can log on to www.401k.com.  You can also direct the investment of your account by calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and either speak directly to a service representative (any business day between the hours of 8:30 AM and 12:00 Midnight) or go through the Plans Voice Response System.    Once you begin contributing to the Plan and you have not directed your contributions to a specific investment, your contributions will be automatically invested in the Plans default fund.  The Plans default fund will consist of a target date retirement fund, or TDF, that closely matches your retirement date based on a projected retirement age of 65.  For more information, please see the Target Date Retirement Funds discussion under INVESTMENT OPTIONS in this document.  This default fund may not provide the most appropriate level of risk versus reward for your particular circumstances, so evaluating and selecting your investments is extremely important.  You can always change your investment direction, including exchanging previously contributed funds, on any business day by logging on to www.401k.com or calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  When you first direct the investment of your contribution to your account, you will:   establish a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be used to access your account in the future, and     9  choose how you want to invest your own contributions.  Company Matching Contributions can be directed to any investments available within the Plan.  If you choose not to direct your Company Matching Contributions, these contributions will be invested in Sherwin-Williams company stock as noted above.  Please remember, you always have the ability to change your Company Matching Contributions to other investments within the Plan.    Investing In Company Stock  You should carefully and periodically evaluate the amount of your accounts invested in Sherwin-Williams company stock.  You want to ensure that the amount of your investment in Sherwin-Williams company stock does not exceed a percentage of your overall retirement savings that is appropriate for your individual situation.  Contact your personal financial or investment advisor if you have any questions. CHANGING INVESTMENT FUNDS  You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to transfer (exchange) a portion or all of your employee and employer account balances from one fund to another.   Transfers can be in whole percentages, or you can request specific dollar amounts to be transferred from one fund to another.    If you request a transfer (exchange) of funds after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or on weekends, holidays or other times the market is not open for business, you will receive the next business days closing price. Requests received prior to 4:00 p.m. will receive that business days closing price. Also, while the available funds seldom have to interrupt the ability to transfer in and out, these funds, including Sherwin-Williams company stock, may modify or suspend the transfer (exchange) provision for a period of time to protect the interests of the funds shareholders. This may happen in instances where excessive trading or conversion out of an investment option can undermine the objective of the fund.  Each time you call and make a change you will receive a written confirmation of the change.  INVESTMENT OPTIONS  The money that you and the Company contribute to the Plan is put into an investment account that is credited with gains and losses.  You direct the Plan on how you want your account to be invested among the various investment options that are made available to you under the Plan.   The Plan offers a broad range of investment options representing all the primary asset classes (short-term investments, bonds and stocks).  You can log on to the Companys retirement plan website at www.401k.com to obtain the full list of investment funds that are available to you.  The investment options offered by the Plan have different investment objectives, allowing you to choose which investment options present the level of risk versus reward      10 you feel is appropriate for your financial goals.  More information regarding the investment objectives of the various investment options, as well as the fees and expenses associated with each available investment option, is available at www.401k.com or by calling the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and requesting free fund prospectuses.  The different investment options provide a range of risk, liquidity, and investment return opportunities.  No one, including the Company or the Recordkeeper, recommends any investment over the other.  You will need to assess what investments meet your objectives.  Your selection of options should take into account your personal financial situation, including your total assets and investments both inside and outside the Plan and how long you intend to have the funds invested.  Target Date Retirement Funds The Plan offers target date retirement funds, or TDFs, as an investment option for employees who do not want to actively manage their retirement savings.  TDFs automatically rebalance to become more conservative as an employee gets closer to retirement.  The target date refers to a target retirement date, and often is part of the name of the fund.  TDFs offer a long-term strategy based on holding a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments (this mix is called an asset allocation) that automatically changes over time as the participant ages.  A TDF's initial asset allocation, when the target date is a number of years away, usually consists mostly of stocks or equity investments, which often have greater potential for higher returns but also can be more volatile and carry greater investment risk.  As the target retirement date approaches, the fund's asset allocation shift to include a higher proportion of more conservative investments, like bonds and cash instruments, which generally are less volatile and carry less investment risk than stocks.  As mentioned earlier, if you do not provide an investment direction for amounts you contribute to the Plan, as a default your contributions will be automatically invested in a TDF based on the year you will reach age 65.  Diversification Federal law provides specific rights concerning investment in The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund.  In particular, you can diversify both your contributions and Company Matching Contributions made to The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund to any other investment fund available within the Plan at any time, unless the investment fund is closed to new participants by the fund manager.  Should you wish to transfer diversified money back into The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund, you may do so on any business day.  Please note that short-term trading fees may be applied to transfers depending on the length of time funds are held.  The Importance of Diversifying Your Retirement Savings To help achieve long-term retirement security, you should give careful consideration to the benefits of a well-balanced and diversified investment portfolio. Spreading your assets among different types of investments can help you achieve a favorable rate of return, while minimizing your overall risk of losing money. This is because market or other economic conditions that cause one category of assets, or one particular security, to perform very well often cause another asset category, or another particular security to perform poorly. If you invest more than 20% of your retirement savings in any one company or industry, your savings may not be properly diversified. Although      11 diversification is not a guarantee against loss, it is an effective strategy to help you manage investment risk.  In deciding how to invest your retirement savings, you should take into account all of your assets, including any retirement savings outside of the Plan. No single approach is right for everyone because, among other factors, individuals have different financial goals, different time horizons for meeting their goals, and different tolerances for risk. Therefore, you should carefully consider the rights described in this notice and how these rights affect the amount of money that you invest in company stock through the Plan.  It is also important to periodically review your investment portfolio, your investment objectives, and the investment options under the Plan to help ensure that your retirement savings will meet your retirement goals.  VESTING  Vesting gives you ownership of the money in your account, which means that you can take your vested account balance with you when you leave the Company.   You are always 100% vested in both your Plan contributions and the Company Matching Contributions.   HOW YOUR ACCOUNT IS VALUED  Your account is valued at the end of every business day the financial markets are open. You can log on to www.401k.com or call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a current account balance.   Account Statements Statements are always available online at www.401k.com.  If you chose to receive paper statements, you will receive a statement at the end of each quarter showing your balance at the beginning of the quarter, the account activity for the quarter and an ending balance for the quarter. Your statement will be sent to you within a reasonable time after the close of the quarter.  YOUR BENEFICIARY  It is absolutely essential that you establish one or more beneficiaries to receive your account balance in the Plan in the event of your death.   The Recordkeeper provides a secure web site for electing, storing, and updating your beneficiary designations.  This secure online service protects the privacy of your information while making sure beneficiary information is available when its needed.  You can change or review your beneficiary at any time by accessing this site.  Log on to www.401k.com and access Fidelity's Online Beneficiary Service by clicking Beneficiaries in the About You section within the Your Profile tab.  Failure to designate a beneficiary could result in your vested Plan account balance being paid to your estate.  All employees eligible to participate in the Plan will be required to complete a beneficiary form.  If you are married and you do not want to name your spouse as your      12 beneficiary, your spouse must consent in writing witnessed by a notary public indicating his/her consent to your designation of another beneficiary.  Call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 for more information regarding this process.    As events in your life change over time, you can always update your beneficiary designations by logging in at www.401k.com or by contacting the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to obtain a paper beneficiary designation form.  DOMESTIC PARTNERS  If you have a domestic partner, under the Plan you will be treated as married, and your domestic partner will generally be treated as a spouse.  If you do not name a beneficiary and you have a domestic partner, your domestic partner will be your beneficiary.  For purposes of the Plan, a domestic partner means (1) a person (of the same-sex or opposite-sex) with whom you have a current valid domestic partnership registration, civil union certificate, or similar document from any state or local government agency authorized to perform such registration or civil union, or (2) if no valid partnership registration, civil union certificate, or similar document exists from any state, a person (of the same-sex or opposite-sex) in a relationship with you where you have:   Have lived together for at least one year;  Are both age 18 years or older and mentally competent to enter into a legal contract;  Are both in an exclusive relationship  Are both not married to anyone else;  Are both not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the state;  Share the same regular and permanent residence with the current intent of doing so indefinitely;  Are financially interdependent on each other which financial interdependence may be subject to documentation in accordance with procedures established by the Plans Administration Committee (Administration Committee), to the extent consistent with pertinent law; and  Were mentally competent to enter into the relationship at the time when the domestic partnership began.  Please note that for purposes of Plan rollover rules, under federal tax law your domestic partner is not treated as a spouse.  Similarly, your domestic partner is not treated as a spouse for purposes of tax rules relating to required minimum distributions following your death.  Please note that effective June 26, 2013, if you are married to a person of the same sex in a marriage validly entered into in a state whose laws authorize the marriage of two persons of the same sex, you are married for all Plan and tax purposes, and the domestic partner provisions described above do not apply.           13 OBTAINING FUNDS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT  The Plan is designed primarily for long term savings.  However, there are limited ways for you to obtain money from your account if you need it before retirement.  Loans You have the option to initiate a loan from your account if you are an active employee.  As long as you repay your loan in full and in accordance with its terms, a loan from the Plan will not be a taxable event.  The basic loan provisions are as follows:  You may borrow a minimum of $1,000, up to a maximum of $50,000, or 50% of your vested balance, whichever is lower.  The term of your loan may not exceed 5 years, unless you are using the loan to purchase a primary residence, in which case, it cannot exceed 10 years.  The interest rate for the loan equals the prime interest rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal, plus one percent.  You pay a maintenance fee for any outstanding loan.  The fee is deducted automatically from your account balance on a quarterly basis.  You will pay back the loan, including principal and interest, through payroll deductions.  These payments are separate and are in addition to your contributions to the Plan.  The interest you pay (along with the principal) goes into your account.  If payments are due at a time when you are not on the payroll, payments can be made in accordance with procedures established by the Administration Committee.  You may pay off your loan early without penalty.  You may have only one outstanding loan at any time.   In determining the amount available for a loan, the Plan will look back one year to determine what, if any, was your largest outstanding loan balance.  This amount will be subtracted from the amount you would otherwise be eligible for based on the basic loan rules noted above.  During an approved leave of absence it may be possible for you to suspend payments for a limited period of time (although interest will continue to accrue); notice must be provided to the Administration Committee.  Suspension is also permitted in connection with a military leave.  If you do not make a loan payment required under the terms of the loan by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter when payment was due, the loan will go into default, and the amount outstanding will be considered a deemed distribution and will be taxable to you as if it were a Plan distribution.  You can initiate a loan transaction, or pay off a loan, by contacting the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015.  The loan transaction will be processed over the phone (except for loans that exceed 5 years, which will be processed by a form) and the resulting funds mailed to you generally within 7 to 10 business days.          14 Withdrawals As a Plan participant, you may be eligible for limited withdrawal options as well.  Please refer to the section FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION when considering a withdrawal of funds from your account.  Age 59  Withdrawal This withdrawal type is limited to employees who are age 59  or older.  You may withdraw up to 100% of your vested account balance, including your pre-tax contributions.  The minimum withdrawal is  $1,000.  You will be subject to income taxes (but not any excise tax) when you withdraw under this withdrawal type. Roth After-Tax Withdrawal To avoid the payment of excise taxes, there are several limitations to accessing Roth 401(k) after-tax contributions.  These limitations include a five (5) year waiting period beginning with the year following the year in which Roth 401(k) contributions were first made, and a minimum age of 59 .  If you made non-Roth after-tax provisions under prior Plan provisions, you may initiate a non-Roth after-tax contribution withdrawal once every 24 months, as discussed in more detail below.  Hardship Withdrawal If you experience certain financial hardships while you are employed, you may be able to make a Hardship Withdrawal from the Plan if certain requirements are met.  In accordance with IRS regulations, you must show evidence of serious financial hardship by submitting appropriate documentation. The Internal Revenue Service considers hardships to include certain medical expenses that qualify under Internal Revenue Code Section 213, purchase of a primary residence, post-secondary tuition for yourself, your spouse, children or dependents, funds needed to prevent eviction or foreclosure on your home, certain funeral expenses or damage to a principal residence that qualifies for a casualty deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 165.  You will be subject to taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty when you withdraw (unless you are age 59  or older), and you will be suspended from making any contributions to the Plan for at least six months after your withdrawal.  The suspension of your contributions will occur as soon as administratively possible.  You are not permitted to roll over hardship withdrawal amounts.  During the period November 16, 2012 through February 1, 2013, hardship withdrawals for needs arising from Hurricane Sandy were also permitted under the Plan rules.  Full Distributions If you terminate employment with the Company for any reason, you may request a full distribution of your vested account balance or arrange a direct rollover.  If you do not arrange a direct rollover, you will be subject to taxes and a possible 10% early withdrawal penalty.  The 10% early withdrawal penalty will not apply to a distribution made to you from the Plan after termination of employment with the Company IF your termination of employment occurs in the calendar year you reach age 55 or later; otherwise, the penalty generally applies to any distribution made to you from the Plan before you reach age 59-1/2.  Please note that if you arrange for a direct rollover to an      15 IRA, any withdrawals you make from the IRA prior to age 59-1/2 (even if you are 55 or older) may be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.  Withdrawal Options for Employees with Pre-2002 Balances The following withdrawal options are only available for participants who are employees and have pre-2002 balances in their accounts.  Only the pre-2002 balances are eligible for these withdrawal options.  After-Tax Withdrawals - You may withdraw an amount up to 100% of your non-Roth after-tax contribution account. The minimum withdrawal is $1,000 (or the entire account balance, is less), and such withdrawals cannot be made more than once in any 24 month period.  Depending on availability, the after-tax contribution withdrawal may include the following sources of money:   Pre-1987 After-tax Contributions - this money is available only to employees who made contributions on an after-tax basis prior to 1987.  There is no tax implication for withdrawing the Pre-1987 contribution portion.  Post-1986 non-Roth After-tax Contributions - this money includes any after-tax contribution invested after 1986 that are not related to Roth 401k contributions.  According to the tax laws, you must withdraw a portion of earnings on Post 1986 contributions, and as a result, will pay income taxes on the earnings and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty on the earnings.  Other In-Service Withdrawals may be made with respect to certain accounts, in each case with a minimum withdrawal of $1,000.  You will be subject to income tax and a possible 10% early withdrawal penalty.  Depending on availability, an In-Service Withdrawal may include the following sources of money: After-tax Contributions, Rollover Contributions, and any Trustee Transfer Contributions from acquisition plans.  If you have at least 5 years of vesting service, you may also withdraw your pre-2002 Company Matching and Company Bonus contributions under an in-service withdrawal.  Withdrawals from each type of account cannot be made more than once in any 24 month period.  Withdrawals While Absent on Military Duty If you are absent from employment with the Company to perform military service, you may be entitled to withdraw amounts from your account.  Deemed Severance of Employment:  If you are absent from employment because of military service for more than 30 days, federal law permits the Plan to treat you as if you had terminated employment, but solely to allow you to withdraw amounts from your account that are not otherwise available for withdrawal. In particular, if you are deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose, you may withdraw all or part of your 401(k) contributions.  Your withdrawal will be effective as soon as practicable after requested.  If you take a withdrawal because of your deemed termination of employment, you will not be permitted to make 401(k) contributions to the Plan (or any other plan maintained by the Company) for 6 months from the date of the withdrawal, and a 10% early distribution penalty may apply. This suspension requirement and early distribution      16 penalty will not apply if your withdrawal qualifies as a qualified reservist distribution, as described below.  Qualified Reservist Distributions:  If you are a reservist or national guardsman and are called to active duty either (1) for an indefinite period or (2) for a period longer than 179 days, any withdrawal you make because of your deemed termination of employment, as described above in Deemed Severance of Employment, will qualify as a qualified reservists distribution.  A qualified reservist distribution must be made during the period beginning on the date you are ordered or called to active duty and ending on the date your active duty period closes. Your distribution is not subject to the 10% penalty tax on early distributions described in Federal Tax Information under Penalty and Excise Taxes. In addition, federal law permits you to repay the amount of a qualified reservist distribution to an individual retirement account (IRA) within 2 years after you cease active duty. This permits you to build back your retirement funds. Finally, if your withdrawal is a qualified reservist distribution, you will not be subject to the 6 months suspension on making 401(k) contributions to the Plan.  Your qualified reservist distribution will be effective as soon as practicable after requested.  You can call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 to initiate any withdrawal from the Plan.  Withdrawals (other than Hardship Distributions) will be processed and the resulting funds mailed to you generally within 7 to 10 business days.  If you elect to receive a distribution in shares, the share certificate will be mailed to you generally within 15 to 20 business days.  Dividends Dividends on The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund:  To the extent your account is invested in The Sherwin Williams Company Stock Fund, you have the right to elect to receive any dividends paid by the Company on its common stock in the form of cash.  Alternatively, the dividends can be reinvested in The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund to purchase additional units.  If you do not make an active election to receive your dividends in cash, the related dividends will automatically be reinvested in The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund for your account.  Other Items If you terminate employment with the Company and your vested account balance is $5,000 or less, such balance will be automatically distributed in accordance with the law.  If $1,000 or less, such balance will be paid to you in a single payment.  If greater than $1,000 (but $5,000 or less), and you do not otherwise elect, then the distribution shall be paid in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the Plans Administration Committee.  If you terminate employment with the Company and your vested account balance is greater than $5,000, you may leave your balance in the Plan.  However, the Plan and the Internal Revenue Code provide that a distribution of your account balance must commence no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you attain age 70  (unless you are still employed with the Company at such time).       17 Federal income taxes are withheld at a rate of 20% from all cash distributions, unless eligible rollover distributions are directly rolled over to another employers qualified plan or an IRA.  Any required state tax withholding may also apply.  If you are withdrawing from The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund, you may request a distribution in cash or shares.  Please note, a withdrawal of shares will not result in the 20% mandatory withholding, and other special tax rules surrounding such a distribution may also apply.  ROTH CONVERSION CONTRIBUTIONS  In the case of amounts that are not attributable to your Roth 401(k) contributions under the Plan, you are permitted to make an in-plan Roth direct rollover for amounts that are otherwise eligible for distribution or withdrawal under the Plan and/or an in-plan Roth transfer for vested amounts that are otherwise not eligible for distribution or withdrawal under the Plan, if otherwise eligible for Roth transfer under the tax laws (these are referred to here as Roth Conversion Contributions\").  If you elect to make such a Roth Conversion Contribution, the taxable amount of your converted account will be included in your federal taxable income for the taxable year in which the Roth Conversion Contribution is made.  Later distributions of your Roth Conversion Contribution account will be taxable as described below.  You are limited to making one Roth Conversion Contribution with respect to all or part of an account in any 12 month period.  Note that once any part of your account is converted to a Roth Conversion Contribution account, you may not later undo your election.  The following special rules apply to your Roth Conversion Contributions.  Separate accounting:  Your Roth Conversion Contributions will be separately accounted for under the Plan.  5-year period for tax exclusion:  The 5-year period that must elapse in order for the earnings on your Roth Conversion Contributions to be tax-free upon distribution runs from the first day of the calendar year in which you first make a Roth contribution to the Plan, which may be the time you make the Roth Conversion Contribution.  (Remember, for a distribution of earnings to be tax free, it must also be a qualified distribution as described below under Withdrawal of Roth 401(k) and/or Roth Conversion Contributions under FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION.)  Protected rights:  Any special distribution rules (e.g., in-service withdrawal rights) that applied to the amounts you elect to convert to Roth Conversion Contributions are preserved after the conversion.  FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION  The Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and to meet the requirements for an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  The related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions made by the Company on behalf of participants in the Plan are deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes.       18 Employee Contributions: Employee pre-tax (or 401(k)) contributions reduce the employees gross income and are not subject to federal income taxes at the time of contribution. However, employee pre-tax contributions will be subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes in the year of contribution.   Employee Rollover of Funds into the Plan: Employees may roll over into the Plan a taxable distribution from a prior employers qualified plan or a qualified conduit individual retirement account (IRA), provided the funds are (1) rolled over within 60 days from the date the employee received the distribution, or (2) received directly from the trustee of the prior employers qualified plan or the IRA custodian or trustee. A conduit IRA is one that contains only funds distributed from a prior employers qualified plan plus the earnings thereon. The funds rolled into the Plan will be fully vested and nonforfeitable, but such funds do not qualify for employer matching contributions.  With respect to Plan loans and withdrawals, the rolled over funds are treated in the same manner as pre-tax contributions.  Employer Contributions: Company contributions on behalf of a contributing employee are not includible in the employees gross income, and are not subject to federal income, Social Security or Medicare taxes at the time of contribution.  Plan Earnings: Earnings or appreciation on employee pre-tax contributions, employee non-Roth after-tax Contributions and Company Matching Contributions are not subject to federal income tax until such amounts are withdrawn by the employee or are distributed to the employee upon termination of employment, or are distributed to a beneficiary in the event of the employees death.  Earnings or appreciation on Roth after-tax contributions under current law are not subject to federal income taxes if the distribution is made in accordance with requirements of the law; see below for further detail.  Withdrawals of Employee (Participant) Non-Roth After-Tax Contributions:  If a participant withdraws after-tax contributions made prior to 1987, such amounts, being a return of after-tax contributions, will not be subject to federal income tax. If a participant withdraws non-Roth after-tax contributions made after 1986, such amounts will be treated in part as a distribution of after-tax contributions and in part as a distribution of earnings and appreciation. The withdrawal of after-tax contributions will not be subject to federal income tax, but the distribution of earnings and appreciation will be subject to federal income tax and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Withdrawals of Employee (Participant) Pre-Tax Contributions:  Withdrawals of pre-tax contributions may be made after the participant attains age 59  or incurs a separation of employment. Withdrawal of pre-tax contributions prior to the time the participant attains age 59  and while the participant is working for the employer is limited to hardship situations. Generally, a hardship exists only if a participant can demonstrate that there is an immediate and heavy financial need, and a withdrawal of pre-tax contributions is necessary to satisfy such financial need.  All withdrawals of pre-tax contributions are subject to federal income taxes and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Withdrawals of Employer (Company) Contributions: Withdrawals of employer contributions along with earnings and appreciation thereon will be subject to federal      19 income tax as ordinary income and may be subject to additional taxes as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Withdrawals of Roth 401(k) and/or Roth Conversion Contributions:  If you receive distribution of your Roth 401(k) Contributions or Roth Conversion Contributions less than 5 years after the first day of the calendar year in which you first made Roth 401(k) Contributions or Roth Conversion Contributions to the Plan (or, if you rolled over Roth contributions from another plan to the Plan, the calendar year in which you first made Roth contributions to the other plan), the earnings on your Roth 401(k) Contributions or Roth Conversion Contributions will be taxable.  In addition, if distribution of your Roth 401(k) Contributions, Roth Conversion Contributions, or rolled over Roth contributions is made to you before you reach age 59 1/2 or become disabled, the earnings on your Roth 401(k) Contributions, Roth Conversion Contributions, or Roth contributions rolled over from another plan will be taxable.  Lump Sum Distributions upon Termination of Employment, including Retirement, Total Disability, and Death: The Plan provides that a distribution due to retirement, death, total disability, or other termination of employment may be made in a lump-sum distribution. The amount of the lump-sum distribution equal to the sum of after-tax contributions not previously withdrawn is not subject to federal income tax. The amount of the lump-sum distribution in excess of after-tax contributions not previously withdrawn, including earnings and appreciation on company and employee contributions, is subject to federal income tax as ordinary income.  However, a qualifying lump-sum distribution may be eligible for special ten-year income averaging (if you were born prior to January 1, 1936) for federal income tax purposes.  If a distribution is taken in shares of Sherwin-Williams Company Stock, which is permitted as part of a lump-sum distribution, the excess, if any, of the fair market value of such Sherwin-Williams Stock over the cost of such Sherwin-Williams Stock is not subject to federal income taxes at the time of distribution, but generally will be subject to federal income tax (which may be capital gain rather than ordinary income) upon subsequent disposition of the Sherwin-Williams Stock. A lump-sum distribution may be subject to penalty and excise taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.  Rollover of Distributions: A participant may defer federal income tax on all or any portion of a withdrawal (other than hardship distributions and minimum required distribution amounts) or a lump-sum distribution that is rolled over to another qualified plan or to an IRA (including a Roth IRA). (When it is desired to roll over a Roth distribution, it should be noted that Roth accounts can only be rolled over to another Roth vehicle, such as a Roth IRA.) A rollover can be made (1) by having the Plan trustee transfer all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution directly to another qualified plan or to the participants IRA, or (2) by having the Trustee distribute the full amount of a withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to the participant and the participant transfers all or a portion of the withdrawal or lump-sum distribution to another qualified plan or to the participants IRA within 60 days after the participant receives the funds. If the Trustee transfers the funds to another qualified plan or the participants IRA, the funds transferred are not subject to mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding. However, if the Trustee transfers the funds to the participant, the transferred funds are subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. A subsequent distribution from an IRA will be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income and will not qualify for special ten-year income averaging. Generally, the amount of the lump-sum distribution      20 rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA will not be subject to excise or penalty taxes, but a subsequent distribution of a rolled over amount from another qualified plan or IRA may be subject to excise or penalty taxes, as described under the section Penalty and Excise Taxes.   Penalty and Excise Taxes: Unless certain exceptions apply, the taxable portion of any withdrawal, or the taxable portion of a lump-sum distribution that is not rolled over may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if the distribution is made before the employee attains age 59 .  There are a number of exceptions to the 10% penalty tax, not all listed below.  In particular, the 10% penalty tax does not apply:  If you separate from the Company in or after the year in which you reach age 55 and receive a distribution from the Plan following your separation.  If a distribution is made to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order.  If the distribution is a qualified reservist distribution.  The federal tax information contained in this SPD briefly explains the federal tax aspects of participation in the Plan. The federal tax laws regarding participation in the Plan are extremely complex and no attempt has been made here to deal with the many special provisions that could be applicable to a particular situation or with the rules governing state, local or foreign taxes. Participants should consult their own counsel or other tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences to them or their beneficiaries.

If You Retire If you retire from the Company, you can choose to withdraw your account at any time (subject to certain rules outlined below).  The normal retirement age under the Plan is 65.  You may contact the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and request a distribution of your account. If you continue to maintain an account balance in the Plan after retirement, you will continue to be a Plan participant subject to the following:  You will not be able make partial withdrawals from your account.

At that time you may elect a lump sum or periodic payments in the amount necessary to satisfy minimum required distribution rules under federal tax regulations.  Your account will be distributed to your named beneficiary should you die before age 70 .  If You Terminate Employment If you leave the Company for any reason other than retirement, the value of your account will automatically be distributed in accordance with the law (and as described above) if      21 the total value is $5,000 or less.  Account balances above $5,000 will remain in the Plan and will require your consent before your account can be distributed. If you do not call the Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015 and request a distribution of your account, you will continue to be a Plan participant subject to the following:  You will not be able to make partial withdrawals from your account.  You cannot take out a loan from your account.  You will be eligible to change investment options.  You can request a full distribution of your account any time.

While you are on a leave of absence you can continue to make withdrawals from the Plan and transfer funds among the Plans investment options.    If You Are Totally Disabled If your employment has not terminated and you are considered totally disabled, you will remain a participant in the Plan. Totally disabled means you are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. You may be required to provide proof of total disability. If you are considered totally disabled, you may request distribution in a single lump sum up to the full amount of your account (but not less than $1,000 unless your account is less than that amount).

You will be eligible to change investment options.  You will be eligible to request a full distribution any time.  You will be required to take a minimum distribution each year after you attain age 70 .

If your spouse does not request a full distribution, your spouse:  Will not be eligible to contribute to the account.  Will be eligible to change investment options.  Will be eligible to request a full distribution any time.  Will be required to begin taking mandatory distributions when you would have turned 70  if your death occurs before age 70  .   Will be required to continue taking mandatory distributions if you die after 70 .  SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO RESIDENTS  If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico law applies to your account as well as United States law.  Therefore, some Plan provisions may be different for you than for other Participants.  These special provisions are described below:  If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, you may only make Pre-tax 401(k) Contributions to the Plan.  You are not eligible to make Roth 401(k) Contributions.  Puerto Rico law limits the total contributions you may make each year to the Plan and to an IRA.  Therefore, if you are a resident of Puerto Rico and make contributions to an IRA, the amount you may contribute to the Plan as 401(k) Contributions may be further limited because of your contributions to the IRA.  The combined limit under Puerto Rico law is the total of the deductible IRA limit applicable under Puerto Rico law ($5,000 for 2015, adjusted annually) plus the limit applicable to plans that are qualified only in Puerto Rico.  For 2015, this limit is $15,000 (adjusted annually).  Therefore, your 401(k) Contributions for 2015 plus your 2015 contributions to a deductible IRA cannot exceed $20,000 (adjusted annually).  If you are a resident of Puerto Rico, the Catch-Up Contribution limit is $1,500 for years beginning after 2011.  In addition, there are special tax rules in Puerto Rico that affect your distribution.  The following summary of the principal Puerto Rico income tax consequences of participation in the Plan, which apply to Participants who are residents of Puerto Rico, is based on the pertinent provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for a New Puerto Rico of 2011 (the Puerto Rico Code).  You should be aware that the Puerto Rico Code is subject to change and that such changes may be applied retroactively.  The Puerto Rico tax effects of participation in the Plan may vary depending on the facts and circumstances pertaining to each participant.  You should consult your own tax advisor or financial planner concerning the Puerto Rico tax consequences to you of participation in the Plan when making any contribution, withdrawal, or distribution election under the Plan.  Your Pre-tax 401(k) contributions to the Plan ordinarily will not be immediately taxed as ordinary income so long as the Plan remains qualified under the Puerto Rico Code.  However, any portion of your Pre-tax 401(k) contributions distributed to you from the Plan to satisfy the discrimination requirements of the Puerto Rico Code or to satisfy other limits of the Puerto Rico Code will be currently taxable to you.       23 You will not be taxed immediately on the Companys contributions to the Plan on your behalf or on dividends or other income that is credited to your account so long as the Plan remains tax-qualified.  You will be taxed on these amounts in the manner described below when they are actually distributed to you.  When you receive a withdrawal or distribution from your account, you will owe Puerto Rico income taxes on the amount that has not yet been taxed except for the portion of a total distribution (as defined below) that is transferred to another employer plan qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code or to an individual retirement account or annuity under Section 1081.02 of the Puerto Rico Code.  The amount withdrawn or distributed, but not rolled over to another qualified plan or individual retirement account or annuity, including your pre-tax, employer, and rollover contributions, and any investment earnings in your account, will be included in your gross income and taxed as ordinary income, subject to the exceptions set forth below.  All or a portion of a total distribution may be transferred to a nondeductible individual retirement account under Section 1081.03 of the Puerto Rico Code, but the transferred amount will be subject to tax, although the tax obligation will be considered to have been satisfied by the withholding of tax on the distribution if the remainder of the distribution is transferred to the nondeductible individual retirement account.  After-tax contributions included in a withdrawal or distribution are not taxed.  If a withdrawal or distribution constitutes only part of your account, an allocable portion of your after-tax contributions generally is included in the withdrawal or distribution.  If your total account is distributed within a single taxable year due to your separation from service or plan termination (a total distribution), the amount of the total distribution in excess of the amount of your after-tax contributions is considered as long-term capital gain subject to a tax of 20%.  If your total distribution includes Sherwin Williams company stock, that portion of the total distribution consisting of Sherwin Williams company stock is not subject to tax at the time of distribution.  For purposes of determining the amount of gain or loss upon a future disposition of the Sherwin Williams company stock, your basis in the stock is equal to the amount of your after-tax contributions.  If your distribution is made after separation from service in the form of periodic payments, the distribution will be exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation in an amount up to $11,000 per year ($15,000 per year if you attain age 60 or over as of the last day of the year).  A total distribution generally is subject to withholding of 20% of the amount of the distribution in excess or your after-tax contributions.  Withholding tax does not apply to that portion of a total distribution consisting of Sherwin Williams company stock, and withholding tax does not apply to the portion of a total distribution that is transferred directly to an individual retirement account or annuity under the provisions of Section 1081.02 of the Puerto Rico Code, to a nondeductible individual retirement account under Section 1081.03 of the Puerto Rico Code, or not another employer plan qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code.       24 Partial distributions made after your separation from service and withdrawals made before separation from service are subject to 10% withholding on amounts in excess of your after-tax contributions.  However, if your distribution is in the form of an annuity or periodic payments by reason of a separation from service, including required minimum distributions, withholding does not apply to the taxable amount of the distribution up to $26,500 for 2014 and $31,000 for 2015 and subsequent years ($30,500 for 2014 and $35,000 for 2015 and subsequent years if you attain age 60 or over by the end of the year).  Assuming the Plan remains qualified under Section 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Code, the Company will generally be entitled to a Puerto Rico income tax deduction equal to the amount it contributes to the Plan.  PLAN MERGERS  From time to time another plan has been merged into the Plan.  These include the Geocel Holdings Corporation 401(k) Plan and the Comex Group 401(k) Plan.  If you were a participant in a merged plan, your account from the merged plan will be maintained in a separate account for you under the Plan with all protected rights preserved.  Otherwise, regular Plan rules will apply.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  Military Leave If you return to employment following a military leave, you may be entitled to benefits under the Plan for the period that you were absent from employment. For example, you will have the opportunity for a limited period of time to make contributions relating to the period you were absent and receive Company Matching Contributions.  You should see your Human Resource Representative for information regarding Plan benefits during military leave.  404(c) Compliance  The Plan is intended to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) Section 404(c).  Section 404(c) provides Plan fiduciaries with certain relief from liability for losses which are the direct and necessary result of participant investment instructions, provided that they have provided reasonable and adequate investment choices and information to participants.  Because you direct how contributions to your accounts are invested (including through the use of certain qualified default investment funds such as life cycle pools about which you have received information), Plan fiduciaries who would otherwise be responsible under federal rules for directing investments are relieved of this responsibility with respect to those contributions.  As a result, those fiduciaries are not liable under the law for any loss to your accounts that are the direct and necessary result of your investment directions.  They are still responsible, however, for providing you with diverse investment opportunities and sufficient opportunity to direct the investment of your account.     You May Not Assign or Alienate Your Account The Plan does not permit you or your beneficiary to assign, alienate, sell, transfer, or pledge the benefits under the Plan to a creditor or to anyone else, nor may any person create a lien on any funds, securities or other property held by the Plan, except in the case      25 of Member Loans through the Plan. These provisions do not apply, however, in cases of certain qualified domestic relations court orders which create rights to Plan benefits for spouses, former spouses, children or other dependents of participants.  Qualified Domestic Relations Order If, as a result of a divorce, you are responsible for child support, alimony or marital property rights payments, all or part of your savings plan benefits may be assigned to meet these payments if a qualified domestic relations order, which the Plan Administrator determines complies with the terms of the Plan, has been issued by a court.  Participants and beneficiaries can obtain, without a charge, copies of such procedures from the Plan Administrator, as well as model orders that may be of use.  Fees relating to processing a qualified domestic relations order may be charged to your account.  Voting of Sherwin-Williams Shares You are entitled to vote your portion of The Sherwin-Williams Company Stock Fund. You will receive the following material before each annual or special shareholders meeting:   A copy of the proxy soliciting material for the meeting.  A form on which you can instruct the trustee as to how to vote your allocated shares of Sherwin-Williams stock.  The trustee will vote the shares as instructed. In addition, the trustee will vote the shares for which it does not receive voting instructions in the same proportions as the shares for which it does receive instructions.  Administrator of the Plan The Administration Committee is the Plan Administrator of the Plan.  The Administration Committee acts for the Company in administering the Plan.  The Administration Committee has the discretionary authority to interpret and apply the Plans provisions in its sole discretion.  The Administration Committee delegates the day-to-day Plan administration functions to the Employee Benefits Department.  The Plan text, trust agreement and the annual report are available for review by Plan participants or their beneficiaries at the Employee Benefits office of The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio 44115 during normal working hours. Upon written request addressed to the Administration Committee, copies of these documents will be furnished, at a reasonable charge, to you as a Plan participant or your beneficiary. This SPD summarizes the main provisions of the Plan in non-technical language. It is not intended to give complete details, especially those details that apply to only a few employees. Full details of the Plan are contained in the legal Plan document.  In the event of any discrepancy between the Plan document and this SPD or in the event of an ambiguity in this SPD, the more detailed provisions of the Plan will govern.  Plan Expenses All of the Plans administrative expenses and fees incident to the operation and management of the Plan and the Plans trust fund are generally paid from the Trust.  This includes costs of purchases and sales under the various investment funds which are      26 charged to the funds.  The administrative expenses allocable to the account of a particular participant may be charged to the participants account, as directed by the Administration Committee.  These expenses may include such items as loan fees and domestic relations order review.  Participants not employed by the Company and maintaining a balance in the Plan may have costs associated with administrative expenses incident to the operation and management of their account in the Plan charged directly to their account.  Recoupment of Benefits In accepting Plan benefits each participant and beneficiary agrees that the Plan has a lien on any overpayment or erroneous payment, as well as any payment by a third party to which the Plan is entitled to enforce its subrogation rights.  Missing Participants or Beneficiaries If you leave the employment of the Company, it is your responsibility to advise the Plan Trustee of any changes in your address. Address changes for terminated employees can be made by contacting the Plans Recordkeeper at 1-800-323-4015. Neither the Administration Committee nor the Trustee shall be required to search for or locate a participant or beneficiary.  If you do not apply for benefits within 90 days of normal retirement date, your account may be forfeited.  It will be reinstated if you or your beneficiary request that your benefits be paid out.  Top-Heavy Rules This Plan contains rules that would take effect automatically for any year in the unlikely event that the Plan becomes top-heavy. A top-heavy plan is one in which the total accounts for certain key (highly-paid) employees exceed 60% of the total accounts for all employees under the Plan. The top-heavy rules provide for, among other things, accelerated vesting of accounts and minimum contribution levels for participants.  The Plan Administrator will advise you of your rights under the top-heavy rules if the Plan becomes top-heavy.  Plan Continuation The Company intends to continue the Plan indefinitely but reserves the right to discontinue the Plan at any time. The Plan may be terminated by action of the Companys Board of Directors.  If the Company terminates the Plan for any reason, the accounts of all members will be used for the exclusive benefit of Plan participants and their beneficiaries. If the Plan either partially or fully terminates, all Plan participants will become fully vested as of the date of such termination and you will receive your distribution according to the terms of the Plan.   The Company can also amend the Plan, at its discretion at any time, or as the law requires.  Claims Review Procedure If your claim for benefits is denied (including any case where you do not think your benefits are properly determined), you may ask the Administration Committee to reconsider the matter within 60 days after receiving a notice of denial. If the Administration Committee does not find that the circumstances warrant any different action from that taken, you will be furnished with a written notice explaining:      27  Specific reasons for the decision.  Specific reference to the pertinent provision of the Plan document on which the decision is based.  Any additional information or facts necessary to complete your claim and an explanation of why such additional information is necessary.  Your right to appeal the decision.  You will usually be notified within 120 days of your request. If special circumstances require an extension of time, you will be notified before the expiration of the 120-day period of the special circumstances and the date (not later than an additional 120 days) by which you will receive a decision.    Within 60 days after you receive a written notification of the decision from the Administration Committee, you or your duly authorized representative may:  File a written appeal to The Sherwin-Williams Company Administration Committee, The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 Prospect Avenue NW, Cleveland, Ohio 44115, for a full and fair review.  Review pertinent documents.  Submit issues and comments in writing. A written decision will usually be made by the Administration Committee within 60 days (45 days, in the case of a claim relating to disability) after it receives your request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing) require an extension of time for not more than an additional 60 days. The decision on review will include the specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.  Any law suit brought with respect to a decision on appeal must be brought within one year of the mailing of the Administration Committees written decision.  ERISA Rights The Plan is an individual account plan under which a participants benefits are based solely upon the amount contributed to the participants account, and any income, gains and losses that may be allocated to that account. The Plan is subject to some, but not all, of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The Plan is generally subject to the provisions of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA which, among other things, require that each participant be furnished with a comprehensive description of his or her rights under the Plan and an annual report of financial condition of the Plan, establish minimum standards for participation and vesting of benefits, and set standards of fiduciary responsibility. The Plan is not subject to ERISA requirements regarding funding, but by its nature the Plan is fully funded at all times. As an individual account plan, the Plan is excluded from coverage under Title IV of ERISA that provides for the guaranty of certain benefits of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:  Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrators office and at other principal offices of the Company, all documents governing the Plan and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of      28 Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.  Obtain copies, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, of all Plan documents governing the operation of the Plan, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. These copies shall be subject to a reasonable charge.  Receive a summary of the Plans annual financial report.  The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report.  Receive annually a statement of your vested benefits or the earliest date on which benefits will become vested.  Receive a written explanation with respect to any denied benefit claim regarding the reasons for such denial and the steps that must be taken in order to have such denial reviewed (For detailed explanation, refer to the Claims Review Procedure section within this Summary Plan Description.)  In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.  The people who operate your Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your employer, your union or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.  If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial, you may obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and you have the right to have the Plan Administrator review and reconsider your claim, all within certain time schedules.  Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request, in writing, a copy of the Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive it within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you with the requested materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive such materials, unless materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.  If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.   In addition, if you disagree with the Plans decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order, you may file suit in federal court.  If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plans money or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.  If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact      29 the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.  NOTICE  This Summary Plan Description is not meant to interpret, extend or change the Plan or Trust in any way.  In case of a conflict between this summary and the actual provisions of the Plan or Trust documents, the latter will govern your benefits and rights.  Each employee should understand that the employment relationship with the Company is an at-will relationship, and as such, may be terminated at any time by either party.  Nothing in this Summary Plan Description is intended to be an express or implied contract of employment, or guarantee of employment for a specific period of time between the employee and the Company, unless clearly so stated in a document signed by the parties.

A diferencia de las contribuciones antes de impuestos, usted incurrir en una obligacin en relacin con el impuesto sobre la renta federal vigente, al igual que en impuestos estatales y locales (segn el lugar donde viva y/o trabaje) relacionados con tales contribuciones cuando estas se efecten.

Hay restricciones sobre los retiros para las contribuciones despus de impuestos. Tales restricciones se explican en la seccin CMO OBTENER FONDOS DE SU CUENTA de esta Descripcin Resumida del Plan.  Usted puede decidir hacer contribuciones al Plan antes de impuestos, despus de impuestos o en una combinacin de ambos tipos de contribuciones. No obstante, toda la contribucin al Plan estar limitada segn los Lmites a las contribuciones resumidos a continuacin.  Lmites a las contribuciones Hay determinadas limitaciones de la legislacin tributaria federal respecto del monto mximo que usted puede contribuir al Plan en un ao calendario. Tales lmites estn sujetos a cambios cada ao, segn la inflacin. para 2015, el lmite es de $18,000 (se ajusta anualmente). Si bien usted puede contribuir el 25 % de su compensacin anual al Plan, estar limitado a contribuciones mximas de $18,000. Segn su compensacin, podr alcanzar el lmite de $18,000 antes de que finalice el ao calendario. Si lo hace, se interrumpirn sus contribuciones al Plan, como as tambin las contribuciones paralelas de la Compaa a las que de otro modo tendra derecho.  Si prev contribuir al Plan el monto mximo permitido en virtud de la legislacin federal, debe planificar detenidamente sus contribuciones al Plan cada ao calendario. Querr maximizar sus contribuciones al Plan sin superar el lmite de $18,000 al final del ao y sin perder la posibilidad de recibir contribuciones paralelas de la Compaa.  Los aumentos en cuanto a las limitaciones de la legislacin tributaria federal respecto de las contribuciones se indexan segn la inflacin. Tenga presente tales lmites cuando considere sus contribuciones al Plan.  Contribuciones de actualizacin Si cumplir 50 aos antes de que finalice el ao del Plan, la legislacin tributaria federal y el Plan le permiten hacer contribuciones adicionales (superiores al lmite de $18,000 para 2015, tal como se describi en el prrafo anterior) al Plan durante ese ao del Plan. Tales contribuciones de actualizacin se hacen al Plan antes de impuestos o despus de impuestos.  En 2015, el lmite de la contribucin de actualizacin es de $6,000. Los aumentos adicionales en cuanto a las limitaciones de la legislacin tributaria federal respecto de las contribuciones de actualizacin se indexan segn la inflacin.       9 Contribuciones paralelas de la empresa Las contribuciones paralelas de la Compaa permiten que sus ahorros aumenten ms rpidamente.

Contribucin paralela discrecional de la Compaa La Compaa tambin puede proporcionar contribuciones paralelas discrecionales a los participantes activos del Plan. El monto de tales distribuciones puede variar, y es posible que la Compaa no proporcione tales distribuciones en un ao del Plan determinado.

CMO CAMBIAR LOS FONDOS DE INVERSIN  Puede iniciar sesin en www.401k.com o llamar al Encargado del registro al 1-800-323-4015 para transferir (cambiar) una parte o la totalidad de los saldos de sus cuentas de      11 empleado y de empleador de un fondo a otro.

Las solicitudes recibidas antes de las 4:00 p. m. recibirn el precio de cierre de ese da hbil. Adems, si bien los fondos disponibles rara vez tienen que interrumpir la capacidad de transferir hacia y desde las cuentas, tales fondos, incluidas las acciones de la compaa Sherwin-Williams, pueden modificar o suspender la prestacin de transferencia (cambio) durante un perodo para proteger los intereses de los accionistas del fondo. Esto puede suceder en casos en los que la excesiva compraventa de acciones o la conversin fuera de una opcin de inversin puedan menoscabar el objetivo del fondo.  Cada vez que llame y haga un cambio, usted recibir una confirmacin por escrito del cambio.  OPCIONES DE INVERSIN  El dinero que usted y la Compaa contribuyan al Plan se colocar en una cuenta de inversin que se acredita con ganancias y prdidas. Usted dirigir el Plan en cuanto a cmo desea que se invierta su cuenta entre las diversas opciones de inversin que se ponen a su disposicin en virtud del Plan.  El Plan ofrece una amplia gama de opciones de inversin que representan a todas las clases de activos primarios (inversiones a corto plazo, bonos y acciones). Puede iniciar sesin en el sitio web de planes de jubilacin de la Compaa en www.401k.com para obtener una lista completa de los fondos de inversin que estn a su disposicin.  Las opciones de inversin ofrecidas por el Plan tienen diferentes objetivos de inversin, lo que le permite elegir qu opciones de inversin presentan el nivel de riesgo frente a la recompensa que usted estime apropiado para sus objetivos financieros. Ms informacin sobre los objetivos de inversin de las distintas opciones de inversin, as como los honorarios y gastos asociados con cada opcin de inversin disponible, est disponible en www.401k.com o llamando al Encargado del registro en 1-800-323-4015 y solicitando folletos informativos gratuitos de los fondos. Las diferentes opciones de inversin proporcionan una gama de oportunidades de riesgo, liquidez y rendimiento de la inversin. Nadie, incluyendo la Compaa o el Encargado del registro, recomienda alguna inversin sobre otra. Usted tendr que evaluar cules inversiones cumplen sus objetivos. Su seleccin de opciones debe tener en cuenta su situacin financiera personal, incluyendo sus activos totales e inversiones dentro y fuera del Plan y el tiempo que planifica tener los fondos invertidos.  Fondos de jubilacin de fecha determinada El Plan ofrece fondos de jubilacin de fecha determinada (target date retirement funds), o TDF, como una opcin de inversin para los empleados que no quieren administrar activamente sus ahorros de jubilacin. Los TDF se reequilibran automticamente para ser ms conservadores a medida que un empleado se acerca a la jubilacin. La \"fecha determinada\" se refiere a una fecha de jubilacin objetivo, y con frecuencia es parte del      12 nombre del fondo. Los TDF ofrecen una estrategia a largo plazo basada en una cartera con una combinacin de acciones, bonos y otras inversiones (esta combinacin se denomina asignacin de activos) que cambia automticamente a travs del tiempo a medida que envejece el participante. La asignacin inicial de los activos de un TDF, cuando la fecha determinada est a un nmero de aos en el futuro, por lo general consiste mayormente en acciones o inversiones permanentes en acciones, que suelen tener mayor potencial para rendimientos ms altos, pero tambin pueden ser ms voltiles y conllevar un mayor riesgo de inversin. A medida que se acerca la fecha determinada de jubilacin, se cambia la asignacin de activos del fondo para incluir una mayor proporcin de inversiones ms conservadoras, como bonos e instrumentos en efectivo, que generalmente son menos voltiles y conllevan menos riesgo de la inversin que las acciones.  Como se mencion anteriormente, si usted no indica la direccin de inversin para los montos que contribuya al Plan, de forma predeterminada sus contribuciones se invertirn automticamente en un TDF en funcin del ao en que cumplir 65 aos.  Diversificacin La legislacin federal brinda derechos especficos respecto de la inversin en el Fondo de acciones de The Sherwin-Williams Company. En particular, usted podr diversificar sus contribuciones y las contribuciones paralelas de la Compaa efectuadas al Fondo de acciones de The Sherwin-Williams Company a cualquier otro fondo de inversin disponible dentro del Plan en cualquier momento, a menos que el administrador del fondo cierre el fondo de inversin a nuevos participantes. En caso de que usted desee transferir dinero diversificado nuevamente al Fondo de acciones de The Sherwin-Williams Company, podr hacerlo en cualquier da hbil. Tenga en cuenta que podrn aplicarse cargos por operaciones a corto plazo a las transferencias, segn el perodo durante el cual se mantengan los fondos.  La importancia de diversificar sus ahorros de jubilacin Para lograr seguridad a largo plazo durante la jubilacin, deber analizar detenidamente los beneficios de una cartera de inversin diversificada y bien equilibrada. Distribuir sus activos entre diferentes tipos de inversiones puede ayudarlo a lograr una tasa de rendimiento favorable y, al mismo tiempo, minimizar su riesgo general de perder dinero. Esto se debe a que las condiciones del mercado u otras condiciones econmicas que hacen que una categora de activos, o un ttulo valor en particular, tenga un muy buen rendimiento suelen hacer que otra categora de activos, u otro ttulo en particular, tenga un mal rendimiento. Si invierte ms del 20 % de sus ahorros de jubilacin en cualquier industria o compaa, es posible que sus ahorros no se diversifiquen adecuadamente. Si bien la diversificacin no ofrece ninguna garanta contra prdidas, es una estrategia efectiva para ayudarlo a administrar el riesgo de inversin.  A la hora de decidir cmo invertir sus ahorros de jubilacin, debe considerar todos sus activos, incluidos los ahorros de jubilacin fuera del Plan. Ningn enfoque nico es adecuado para todos dado que, entre otros factores, las personas tienen metas financieras diferentes, horizontes de tiempo diferentes para alcanzar sus metas y tolerancias al riesgo diferentes. Por lo tanto, debe considerar detenidamente los derechos descritos en este aviso y el modo en que tales derechos inciden en el monto de dinero que usted invierte en acciones de la compaa mediante el Plan.       13 Tambin es importante que revise peridicamente su cartera de inversin, sus objetivos de inversin y las opciones de inversin en virtud del Plan, a fin de asegurarse de que sus ahorros de jubilacin alcancen sus metas para la jubilacin.  ADQUISICIN DE DERECHOS  La adquisicin de derechos le proporciona la titularidad del dinero en su cuenta, lo que significa que usted puede tomar el saldo de su cuenta sobre el que haya adquirido derechos cuando abandone la Compaa.   Usted siempre obtendr el 100 % de derechos adquiridos sobre sus contribuciones al Plan y sobre las contribuciones paralelas de la Compaa.  CMO SE VALA SU CUENTA  Su cuenta se vala al final de cada da hbil en que operen los mercados financieros.

Adems, si la distribucin de sus contribuciones Roth 401(k), contribuciones de conversin Roth o contribuciones Roth reinvertidas se le hace antes de que cumpla la edad de 59 aos y medio o si queda      22 discapacitado, los ingresos de sus contribuciones Roth 401(k), contribuciones de conversin Roth o contribuciones Roth reinvertidas de otro plan sern tributables.

(Si se desea reinvertir una distribucin Roth, se debe tener en cuenta que las cuentas Roth solo se pueden reinvertir en otro instrumento Roth, tal como una IRA Roth). Se puede hacer una reinversin (1) haciendo que el fiduciario del Plan transfiera la totalidad o una parte del retiro o distribucin de una suma global directamente a otro plan calificado o a la IRA del participante; o (2) haciendo que el Fiduciario distribuya el monto total de un retiro o distribucin de una suma global al participante y el participante transfiere la totalidad o una parte del retiro o distribucin de una suma global a otro plan calificado o a la IRA del participante en el transcurso de 60 das desde que el participante reciba los fondos.

Si se efecta una distribucin a un beneficiario alternativo conforme a una orden calificada de relaciones domsticas.  Si la distribucin es una distribucin calificada de reservista.

ESTIPULACIONES ESPECIALES QUE SE EXTIENDEN A RESIDENTES DE PUERTO RICO  Si usted es residente de Puerto Rico, se aplicar a su cuenta la legislacin de Puerto Rico as como la legislacin de los Estados Unidos. Por lo tanto, es posible que algunas estipulaciones del Plan sean diferentes para usted en comparacin con otros participantes. Tales estipulaciones especiales se describen a continuacin:  Si es residente de Puerto Rico, solo puede hacer contribuciones 401(k) antes de impuestos al Plan. No ser elegible para hacer contribuciones Roth 401(k).  La legislacin de Puerto Rico limita el total de contribuciones que usted puede hacer cada ao al Plan o a una IRA. Por lo tanto, si es residente de Puerto Rico y hace contribuciones a una IRA, el monto que usted puede contribuir al Plan como contribuciones 401(k) puede estar an ms limitado debido a sus contribuciones a la IRA. El lmite combinado conforme a la legislacin de Puerto Rico es el total del lmite de una IRA deducible aplicable conforme a la legislacin de Puerto Rico ($5,000 para 2015; se ajusta anualmente) ms el lmite aplicable a planes que estn calificados solo en Puerto Rico. Para 2015, dicho lmite es de $15,000 (se ajusta anualmente). Por lo tanto, sus contribuciones 401(k) para 2015 ms sus contribuciones de 2015 a una IRA deducible no pueden superar los $20,000 (se ajusta anualmente).  Si es residente de Puerto Rico, el lmite de las contribuciones de actualizacin es de $1,500 para los aos que comiencen despus de 2011.  Adems, hay reglas tributarias especiales en Puerto Rico que afectan su distribucin. El siguiente resumen de las principales consecuencias del impuesto sobre la renta de Puerto Rico respecto de la participacin en el Plan, que se aplican a los participantes que son residentes de Puerto Rico, est basado en las estipulaciones pertinentes del Cdigo de Rentas Internas para un Nuevo Puerto Rico de 2011 (el Cdigo de Puerto Rico). Debe saber que el Cdigo de Puerto Rico est sujeto a cambios y que tales cambios podrn aplicarse de manera retroactiva. Es posible que los efectos impositivos de Puerto Rico respecto de la participacin en el Plan varen segn los hechos y las circunstancias relativos a cada participante. Debe consultar con su propio planificador financiero o asesor tributario en relacin con las consecuencias tributarias de Puerto Rico que pueda      26 tener por su participacin en el Plan al hacer contribuciones, retiros o elecciones de distribucin en virtud del Plan.  Sus contribuciones 401(k) antes de impuestos al Plan comnmente no sern gravadas de inmediato como ingresos ordinarios, siempre que el Plan siga calificado en virtud del Cdigo de Puerto Rico. No obstante, por ahora, deber pagar impuestos sobre la parte de sus contribuciones 401(k) antes de impuestos que se le distribuya del Plan para cumplir con los requisitos de discriminacin del Cdigo de Puerto Rico o para cumplir con otros lmites del Cdigo de Puerto Rico.  No se le cobrarn impuestos de inmediato sobre las contribuciones de la Compaa al Plan en su nombre ni sobre los dividendos u otros ingresos que se acrediten a su cuenta, siempre que el Plan siga siendo deducible tributariamente. Se le cobrarn impuestos sobre tales montos de la manera descrita a continuacin cuando se efecte la distribucin.  Cuando reciba un retiro o una distribucin de su cuenta, adeudar los impuestos sobre la renta de Puerto Rico sobre el monto que an no haya sido gravado, a excepcin de la parte de una distribucin total (tal como se define a continuacin) que se transfiera a otro plan calificado del empleador conforme a la seccin 1081.01 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico o a una cuenta de jubilacin individual o anualidad conforme a la seccin 1081.02 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico. El monto retirado o distribuido, pero no reinvertido en otro plan calificado o cuenta de jubilacin individual o anualidad, incluidas las contribuciones antes de impuestos, del empleador y de reinversin, y todo ingreso de inversin en su cuenta, se incluir en su ingreso neto y se gravar como ingreso ordinario, sujeto a las excepciones establecidas a continuacin. La totalidad o una parte de una distribucin total podr transferirse a una cuenta de jubilacin individual no deducible conforme a la seccin 1081.03 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico, pero el monto transferido estar sujeto a impuestos, aunque se considerar que la obligacin tributaria se ha satisfecho mediante la retencin del impuesto sobre la distribucin si el resto de la distribucin se transfiere a la cuenta de jubilacin individual no deducible.  Las contribuciones despus de impuestos incluidas en un retiro o distribucin no se gravan. Si un retiro o una distribucin constituyen solo parte de su cuenta, generalmente se incluir una parte asignable de sus contribuciones despus de impuestos en el retiro o la distribucin.  Si el total de su cuenta se distribuye en el transcurso de un solo ao impositivo debido a que usted se desvincula del servicio o su plan finaliza (una distribucin total), el monto de la distribucin total que supere el monto de sus contribuciones despus de impuestos se considera una ganancia de capital a largo plazo sujeta a un impuesto del 20 %.  Si su distribucin total incluye acciones de la compaa Sherwin-Williams, esa parte de la distribucin total que consta de acciones de la compaa Sherwin-Williams no est sujeta a impuestos en el momento de la distribucin. Para los propsitos de determinar el monto de ganancia o prdida tras una disposicin futura de las acciones de la compaa Sherwin-Williams, su base en las acciones equivale al monto de sus contribuciones despus de impuestos.  Si su distribucin se efecta despus de la desvinculacin del servicio en la forma de pagos peridicos, la distribucin estar exenta del impuesto sobre la renta de Puerto Rico      27 en un monto de hasta $11,000 por ao ($15,000 por ao si usted cumple la edad de 60 aos o ms en o antes del ltimo da del ao).  Por lo general, una distribucin total est sujeta a la retencin del 20 % del monto de la distribucin que supere sus contribuciones despus de impuestos. El impuesto de retencin no se aplica a esa parte de una distribucin total que consta de acciones de la compaa Sherwin-Williams, y el impuesto de retencin no se aplica a la parte de una distribucin total que se transfiere directamente a una cuenta de jubilacin individual o anualidad conforme a las estipulaciones de la seccin 1081.02 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico, a una cuenta de jubilacin individual no deducible conforme a la seccin 1081.03 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico, pero no a otro plan calificado del empleador conforme a la seccin 1081.01 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico.  Las distribuciones parciales efectuadas despus de que usted se desvincule del servicio y los retiros efectuados antes de la desvinculacin del servicio estn sujetos a la retencin del 10 % sobre los montos que superen sus contribuciones despus de impuestos. No obstante, si su distribucin se efecta en la forma de una anualidad o pagos peridicos por una desvinculacin del servicio, incluidas las distribuciones mnimas requeridas, la retencin no se aplica al monto gravable de la distribucin de hasta $26,500 para 2014 y de hasta $31,000 para 2015 y los aos posteriores ($30,500 para 2014 y $35,000 para 2015 y los aos posteriores si usted cumple la edad de 60 aos o ms en o antes del fin de ao).  Suponiendo que el Plan sigue calificado conforme a la seccin 1081.01 del Cdigo de Puerto Rico, la Compaa generalmente tendr derecho a una deduccin del impuesto sobre la renta de Puerto Rico equivalente al monto que contribuya al Plan.  FUSIONES DE PLANES  De vez en cuando, se ha fusionado otro plan al Plan. Por ejemplo, el Plan 401(k) de Geocel Holdings Corporation y el Plan 401(k) de Comex Group. Si usted era participante de un plan fusionado, su cuenta del plan fusionado se mantendr en una cuenta separada para usted en virtud del Plan, y se mantendrn todos los derechos protegidos. De lo contrario, se aplicarn las reglas regulares del Plan.  INFORMACIN ADICIONAL  Licencia militar Si usted regresa al empleo despus de una licencia militar, es posible que tenga derecho a beneficios bajo el Plan por el perodo que se ausent del empleo. Por ejemplo, tendr la oportunidad de un perodo limitado para hacer contribuciones en relacin con el perodo en que estuvo ausente y recibir contribuciones paralelas de la Compaa. Debera ver a su Representante de Recursos Humanos para obtener informacin con respecto a los beneficios del Plan durante la licencia militar.  Cumplimiento de la seccin 404(c)  El Plan pretende cumplir con la seccin 404(c) de la Ley de Seguridad de los Ingresos de Jubilacin de los Empleados (Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA) de 1974. La seccin 404(c) exime de algn modo a los fiduciarios del Plan de toda responsabilidad por las prdidas que sean el resultado directo y necesario de las      28 instrucciones de inversin del participante, siempre que hayan proporcionado opciones de inversin razonables y adecuadas e informacin a los participantes. Dado que usted dirige cmo se invierten las contribuciones en su cuenta (incluso mediante el uso de determinados fondos de inversin predeterminados calificados, como conjuntos de ciclos de vida sobre los cuales ha recibido informacin), los fiduciarios del Plan que de otro modo seran responsables, conforme a las reglas federales, de dirigir las inversiones son eximidos de esa responsabilidad con respecto a tales contribuciones. Como resultado, tales fiduciarios no son responsables conforme a la ley de ninguna prdida en sus cuentas que sea el resultado directo y necesario de sus direcciones de inversin. No obstante, an son responsables de proporcionarle diversas oportunidades de inversin y la oportunidad necesaria para dirigir la inversin de su cuenta.  Usted no podr ceder o enajenar su cuenta El Plan no permite que usted o su beneficiario cedan, enajenen, vendan, transfieran o pignoren los beneficios en virtud del Plan a un acreedor o a cualquier persona, ni que otra persona cree un gravamen sobre fondos, valores u otra propiedad mantenidos por el Plan, excepto en el caso de Prstamos para miembros mediante el Plan. Estas estipulaciones no se aplican, sin embargo, en casos de ciertas rdenes judiciales calificadas de relaciones domsticas que crean derechos para los beneficios del Plan para cnyuges, ex cnyuges, hijos u otros dependientes de los participantes.  Orden calificada de relaciones domsticas Si, como resultado de un divorcio, usted es responsable de pagos para manutencin infantil, pensin alimenticia o derechos a la propiedad conyugal, la totalidad o parte de sus beneficios del plan de ahorros pueden ser asignados para cumplir con estos pagos si un tribunal ha emitido una orden calificada de relaciones domsticas que el Administrador del Plan determina que cumple con los trminos del Plan. Los participantes y los beneficiarios podrn obtener, sin cargo alguno, copias de tales procedimientos del Administrador del Plan, como as tambin modelos de rdenes que pueden ser tiles.

Derechos ERISA El Plan es un plan de cuenta individual en virtud del cual los beneficios de un participante se basan nicamente en el monto contribuido a la cuenta del participante, y en cualquier ingreso, ganancia y prdida que pueda asignarse a esa cuenta. El Plan est sujeto a algunas, pero no a la totalidad, de las estipulaciones de la Ley de Seguridad de los Ingresos de Jubilacin de los Empleados (ERISA) de 1974, y sus enmiendas. El Plan est sujeto generalmente a las estipulaciones del subttulo B del ttulo I de ERISA que, entre otras cosas, requiere que cada participante reciba una descripcin integral de sus derechos en virtud del Plan y un informe anual de la situacin financiera del Plan, establece estndares mnimos para la participacin y la adquisicin de beneficios, y establece estndares de responsabilidad fiduciaria. El Plan no est sujeto a los requisitos de ERISA respecto de la financiacin, pero, por su naturaleza, el Plan est plenamente financiado en todo momento. Como un plan de cuenta individual, el Plan est excluido de la cobertura en virtud del ttulo IV de ERISA que estipula la garanta de determinados beneficios de la Corporacin de Garanta del Beneficio de Jubilacin (Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation).  Como un participante del Plan, usted goza de ciertos derechos y protecciones bajo ERISA. ERISA estipula que todos los participantes del Plan tendrn derecho a:  Examinar, sin cargo alguno, en la oficina del Administrador del Plan y en otras oficinas principales de la Compaa, todos los documentos que rigen el Plan y una copia del ltimo informe anual (Formulario Serie 5500) presentado por el Plan ante el Departamento de Trabajo de los EE.

Recibir una explicacin por escrito con respecto a cualquier reclamo de beneficio denegado con respecto a las razones para dicha denegacin y los pasos que deben tomarse para que dicha denegacin sea revisada (Para una explicacin detallada, consulte la seccin de Procedimiento de Revisin de Reclamos dentro de esta Descripcin Resumida del Plan).       32 Adems de crear derechos para los participantes del Plan, ERISA impone deberes a las personas responsables de la operacin del Plan.  Las personas que operan su Plan, llamados \"fiduciarios\" del Plan, tienen el deber de hacerlo prudentemente y en su inters y en el de otros participantes y beneficiarios del Plan. Nadie, incluso su empleador, su sindicato o cualquier otra persona, podr despedirlo o discriminarlo de ninguna otra forma para impedir que usted obtenga un beneficio o ejerza sus derechos bajo ERISA.  Si su reclamo por beneficio es denegado en su totalidad o en parte, usted deber recibir una explicacin por escrito del motivo de la denegacin, usted podr obtener copias de documentos relativos a la decisin sin ningn cargo y usted tendr derecho a que el Administrador del Plan revise y reconsidere su reclamo, todo dentro de ciertos plazos. Bajo ERISA hay medidas que usted puede tomar para hacer cumplir los derechos anteriores. Por ejemplo, si usted solicita por escrito una copia de los documentos del Plan o el ltimo informe anual del Plan y no lo recibe dentro de 30 das, puede entablar una demanda en una corte federal. En dicho caso, la corte puede exigir que el Administrador del Plan le proporcione los materiales solicitados y pague hasta $110 diarios hasta que usted reciba tales materiales, a menos que los materiales no fueran enviados debido a razones fuera del control del Administrador del Plan.  Si usted tiene un reclamo por beneficios que son denegados o ignorados, en su totalidad o en parte, podr entablar una demanda en un tribunal estatal o federal. Adems, si usted no est de acuerdo con la decisin del Plan o la falta de la misma con respecto al estado calificado de una orden de relaciones domsticas, puede entablar una demanda en una corte federal. En caso de que los fiduciarios del Plan le dieran mal uso al dinero del plan o si usted fuera discriminado por ejercer sus derechos, puede buscar la asistencia del Departamento de Trabajo de los EE. UU. o puede entablar una demanda en una corte federal. La corte decidir quin debera pagar los costos y honorarios legales de la corte. Si usted tiene xito, la corte puede ordenar que la persona que usted ha demandado pague estos costos y honorarios. Si usted pierde, la corte puede ordenar que usted pague estos costos y honorarios; por ejemplo, si encuentra que su demanda es frvola.  Si tiene preguntas acerca del Plan, debera ponerse en contacto con el Administrador del Plan. Si tiene preguntas acerca de esta declaracin o acerca de sus derechos bajo ERISA o si necesita asistencia para obtener documentos de parte del Administrador del Plan, debera ponerse en contacto con la oficina ms cercana de la Administracin de Seguridad de Beneficios de Empleados, Departamento de Trabajo de los EE.UU., que aparece en su directorio telefnico o con la Divisin de Asistencia Tcnica y Consultas (Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries), Administracin de Seguridad de Beneficios de Empleados (Employee Benefits Security Administration), Departamento de Trabajo de los EE.UU.
